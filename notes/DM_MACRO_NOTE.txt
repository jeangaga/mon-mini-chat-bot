STATUS: Live as of Friday close (Feb 6)
MODE: TWO-WEEK SYNTHESIS (Jan 26-30 + Feb 2-6)
FOCUS: Cross-DM regime shifts • Central bank divergence • Labor/inflation nexus
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRIOR REGIME CONTEXT (Jan 19-23):
"UK soft-landing probability rose sharply (PMIs + retail surprise); Japan BoJ stayed ultra-gradual; Australia/NZ rates-stay-restrictive tail fattened; Canada cross-currents keep BoC patient."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEEK 1: JAN 26-30, 2026
SUNDAY 26 JAN — RELEASED
JAPAN — Leading Indicator Revised (Nov)

Transmission: JPY neutral (low-conviction data point)

MONDAY 27 JAN — RELEASED
JAPAN — Service PPI (Dec)

Actual: 2.60% YY vs Prior: 2.70%
Dominant signal: Services price pressure easing slightly
Secondary: Supports "gradual disinflation" but still elevated
Reaction function: Consistent with BoJ patience - services inflation key constraint
Transmission: JPY neutral (disinflation marginal, not accelerating)

TUESDAY 28 JAN — RELEASED
AUSTRALIA — CPI Q4

Headline QQ: 0.6% vs Consensus: 0.6% (in line)

RBA Trimmed Mean CPI YY: 3.4% vs Consensus: 3.3% — BEAT

Dominant signal: WEEK 1 DOMINANT EVENT - Underlying inflation (trimmed mean 3.4% YY, 0.9% QQ) beat consensus across all core measures, keeping RBA in tightening bias despite headline in line
Secondary: Quarterly pace (0.9%) annualizes to ~3.6% - well above RBA comfort zone and target
Noise: Headline matched consensus, but RBA doesn't target headline - trimmed mean is decision-grade input
Reaction function: Materially raises hike probability - trimmed mean 3.4% YY with 0.9% QQ momentum is incompatible with "mission accomplished"
Transmission: AUD rally on front-end repricing (hike from "tail risk" to "base case")

Transmission: SEK depends on guidance (cut signals vs patience)
THURSDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED

TWO-WEEK SYNTHESIS — CROSS-DM REGIME SHIFTS
PRIOR REGIME (Jan 19-23): "UK soft landing rising; BoJ ultra-gradual; AUD/NZD restrictive bias; Canada patient"
UPDATED REGIME: "DM central bank divergence WIDENS — RBA hikes solo while others pause/prep cuts"

WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED (regime-level):
1. AUSTRALIA SHIFTED FROM "HOLD WITH OPTIONALITY" TO "ACTIVE TIGHTENING" — MAJOR BREAK
Prior: RBA on hold since late 2024, easing priced for mid-2026
Now: RBA hiked 25bp to 3.85% on Feb 3 after Q4 CPI trimmed mean 3.4% YY (0.9% QQ beat)
Evidence cluster:

Q4 CPI trimmed mean 0.9% QQ (vs 0.8% consensus) = 3.6% annualized, well above target
Monthly CPI Dec +1.0% MM (vs 0.7% consensus) = Q1 tracking risk elevated
Private credit +0.8% (accelerating) = financial conditions too loose
PMI services 56.3 (strong) = domestic demand not cooling
Trade surplus widened = external support intact

Reaction function shift: From "data-dependent pause" to "willing to hike more if trimmed mean stays >3%"
Cross-market implication: AUD now positively correlated with global rates (higher for longer = AUD strength), reversing prior "dovish Fed helps EM/commodity FX" linkage
Regime trigger going forward:

Dovish reversal: Q1 CPI trimmed mean <0.6% QQ (2.4% annualized) for 2 consecutive quarters → RBA shifts to hold/cut
Hawkish continuation: Trimmed mean >0.8% QQ in Q1 → second hike in April/May


2. CANADA SHIFTED FROM "CROSS-CURRENTS" TO "LABOR MARKET CRACK" — PATTERN ACCELERATION
Prior: BoC pause after cutting cycle; disinflation + resilient consumption = neutral
Now: Employment -24.8k (vs +7.0k consensus) + unemployment 6.5% only due to participation drop = hidden weakness
Evidence cluster:

Jan employment -24.8k (32k miss) = largest downside in 6+ months
Unemployment 6.5% despite job losses = participation fell (discouraged workers leaving)
Nov GDP 0.0% MM (vs 0.1% consensus) = Q4 growth stalling confirmed
Ivey PMI 47.0 (contraction) = activity not rebounding

Reaction function shift: From "patient easing bias" to "cuts likely accelerating" (March/April high probability)
Cross-market implication: CAD now vulnerable to USD strength (losing rate support) + commodity weakness (if global growth slows)

3. SWEDEN CONFIRMED "INFLATION VICTORY + GROWTH CONCERNS" — PATTERN CONTINUATION
Prior: Riksbank easing after hitting inflation target
Now: Q4 GDP major miss (0.2% vs 0.6%) + Jan CPI undershoots = dovish justification complete
Evidence cluster:

Q4 GDP 0.2% QQ (vs 0.6% consensus) = -0.4pp miss, momentum collapsing
Jan CPIF ex-energy 1.7% (vs 1.9% consensus, 2.3% prior) = core disinflation accelerating
Jan CPIF 2.0% (vs 2.1% consensus) = target achieved, no persistence risk

Reaction function: Riksbank can ease aggressively (50bp moves possible) without inflation risk

4. UK HELD "GRADUAL EASING" BUT VOTE SHIFT SIGNALS DOVISH TILT — MARGINAL CHANGE
Prior: BoE cautious easing (services inflation 4.5% constraint)
Now: MPC vote shifted 4-5 (toward cuts from 5-4 prior) = dovish wing growing
Evidence: Manufacturing/services PMIs still >50, house prices stabilizing = growth not collapsing, but BoE preparing March cut

5. JAPAN CONFIRMED "ULTRA-GRADUAL NORMALIZATION" — NO CHANGE
Prior: BoJ patient, waiting for wage/inflation confirmation
Now: Tokyo CPI disinflation surprise (2.0% vs 2.2%) + retail sales weak (-0.9%) = removes hike urgency
Reaction function: BoJ still on hiking path but no acceleration (next hike April at earliest)

CROSS-DM SYNTHESIS: What matters for markets
Central Bank Divergence NOW at maximum:

RBA: Hiking (3.85%, more possible)
BoC: Cutting soon (March/April high probability)
Riksbank: Cutting aggressively (50bp increments possible)
BoE: Cutting gradually (March likely, 25bp)
BoJ: Pausing near-term (next hike delayed)

DM FX hierarchy (rate-adjusted):

AUD: Only hiker = strongest (front-end carry + commodity support)
CHF/JPY: Safe havens + neutral policy = range-bound
GBP: Gradual cuts + growth OK = stable
SEK/NOK: Aggressive cuts + growth concerns = weakest
CAD: Accelerating cuts + labor weakness = vulnerable
NZD: Middle (RBNZ dovish but not emergency)

What did NOT change:

Manufacturing still weak globally (PMIs mixed, hard data soft)
Services resilience persists (Japan, Australia, UK all >50 services PMI)
Housing stabilizing in UK/Australia (not collapsing, not booming)

Next 2 weeks' critical prints:

Australia Q1 CPI (late April): Confirms hike justified or one-off?
Canada Feb employment (Mar 7): Was Jan a blip or trend?
Sweden Feb CPI (Mar 6): Does disinflation continue?
UK Feb CPI (Mar 19): Services inflation sub-4%?
Japan Feb CPI national (Mar 21): Confirms Tokyo disinflation?

DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 19–23, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 19 — RELEASED

Japan — Machinery Orders (Nov)
m/m: -11.0% vs -5.1% consensus vs +7.0% prior
y/y: -6.4% vs +4.9% consensus vs +12.5% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside reset in capex intentions — the corporate investment cycle remains fragile despite better services momentum elsewhere.
Secondary: the y/y swing partly reflects base effects after a strong prior, but the m/m collapse is too large to ignore.
Noise: machinery orders are volatile, but this is a regime-consistent weakness rather than a blip.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ caution — hard to tighten financial conditions meaningfully with capex momentum this weak.
Transmission: caps JPY upside via growth expectations; offsets any inflation-led hawkish tail.

United Kingdom — Rightmove House Prices (Jan)
m/m: +2.8% ; y/y: +0.5%
Dominant signal: seasonal rebound is stronger than usual, pointing to tentative housing stabilisation as rate expectations ease.
Secondary: still low y/y — this is not a re-acceleration cycle, just less downside.
Reaction function: mildly hawkish at the margin for BoE (housing no longer screaming distress), but subordinate to inflation/services.
Transmission: marginal GBP support via domestic demand optics.

Japan — Tertiary Industry Activity (Nov)
Actual -2.4% vs -0.7% prior
Dominant signal: services activity corrected sharply after prior strength.
Secondary: reinforces volatility in Japan’s services data; inconsistent with PMI optimism.
Reaction function: keeps BoJ squarely patient — services inflation may matter, but real activity is uneven.
Transmission: JPY-negative at the margin through growth.

Canada — CPI (Dec)
Headline m/m: -0.2% vs -0.3% consensus
Headline y/y: 2.4% vs 2.2% consensus
BoC core y/y: 2.8% (down from 2.9%)
Median: 2.5% vs 2.7% consensus
Trim: 2.7% in line
Dominant signal: core disinflation is grinding on despite a firmer headline y/y print.
Secondary: breadth matters — median cooling offsets sticky trim.
Reaction function: keeps BoC leaning dovish/patient; no reason to reprice hawkish tails.
Transmission: CAD capped; front-end rates biased lower.

New Zealand — Business PSI (Dec)
Actual 51.9 vs 50.7 prior
Dominant signal: services activity back into expansion.
Reaction function/transmission: mildly supportive for NZD, but CPI dominates this week.

Employment change: +82k vs +30k consensus
Payrolls change: -43k
Avg earnings (3m y/y): 4.7% vs 4.6% consensus
Dominant signal: mixed but still-too-firm wage dynamics despite soft payrolls.
Secondary: employment level strength contrasts with hiring indicators — adjustment via hours/pay rather than headcount.
Reaction function: keeps BoE cautious — wages still inconsistent with rapid easing.
Transmission: front-end gilt downside limited; GBP supported on relative rates.

United Kingdom — Claimant Count (Dec)
Actual +17.9k vs +20.1k prior
Dominant signal: labour market deterioration is gradual, not disorderly.
Reaction function: reinforces gradualism.

New Zealand — Milk Auctions (20 Jan, w/e)
Actual 3,615 vs 3,533 prior

United Kingdom — CPI (Dec)
Headline y/y: 3.4% vs 3.3% consensus
Core y/y: 3.2% vs 3.3% consensus
Services y/y: 4.5% in line
Dominant signal: headline ticked up, but core/services did not re-accelerate.
Secondary: inflation persistence remains services-led, not goods-led.
Reaction function: BoE can still cut, but this does not greenlight urgency.
Transmission: gilt rally capped; GBP stable.

United Kingdom — PPI (Dec)
Input m/m: -0.2% ; output m/m: 0.0%
Dominant signal: pipeline disinflation intact.
Reaction function: supports the medium-term easing case.

Transmission: JPY-negative via trade balance optics.

Australia — Labour Market (Dec)
Employment: +65.2k vs +30k consensus
Unemployment rate: 4.1% vs 4.4% consensus
Participation: 66.7%
Dominant signal: labour market re-tightening — demand for labour remains strong.

Reaction function: materially complicates the RBA easing narrative; keeps hike tail alive despite softer CPI.
Transmission: AUD supported via front-end repricing.

Norway — Labour Force Survey (Dec)

United Kingdom — GfK Consumer Confidence (Jan)
Actual -16 vs -16 consensus
Dominant signal: sentiment stabilised but weak.

m/m: +0.4% vs -0.1% consensus
y/y: +2.5% vs +1.1% consensus

United Kingdom — PMI Flash (Jan)
Composite: 53.9 vs 51.5 consensus
Manufacturing: 51.6 vs 50.6
Services: 54.3 vs 51.7
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise — momentum into 2026 stronger than priced.
Secondary: export orders inflecting matters more than the headline level (if sustained, it’s a regime shift vs “UK stagnation”).
Reaction function: materially reduces near-term cut urgency; hawkish tail fatter (cuts shift from “soon” to “conditional”).
Transmission: GBP-positive; front-end rates reprice higher.

Sweden — Unemployment Rate (Dec)

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS (what’s new / what mattered)

UK: “soft-landing” probability rose sharply — and the BoE cutting narrative got less urgent.
The week started with mixed labour/wages (not weak enough to force cuts), then CPI delivered “no re-acceleration in core/services,” but the key narrative shock was Friday’s UK flash PMIs + retail sales: that combo is exactly what makes the BoE’s reaction function asymmetric (they can ease only if growth cooperates and inflation keeps falling). This week delivered growth cooperation. Net: cuts become later / more conditional rather than “imminent”; GBP support becomes more durable because it’s backed by activity momentum, not just positioning.

Japan: BoJ stayed on rails — the economy still sends mixed signals, so the tightening path stays ultra-gradual.
Hard data (machinery orders, trade balance) argued for caution; surveys (PMIs) argued for resilience. CPI core in line and the policy decision unchanged crystallise the baseline: BoJ is not accelerating the hiking cycle; it’s waiting for sustained, high-confidence confirmation. Net: JPY remains more a function of global rates and risk than of domestic policy surprise.

Australia/New Zealand: the “rates stay restrictive” tail got fatter (for different reasons).
Australia printed a growth/labour/PMI cluster that keeps the RBA constrained (even if inflation is improving elsewhere). New Zealand CPI came in firmer, pushing easing optionality out. Net: AUD/NZD sensitivity tilts back toward front-end repricing rather than pure risk beta.

Canada: cross-currents (disinflation + resilient consumption) keep the BoC in patient mode, not forced either way.
BoC core measures were consistent with disinflation continuing, but retail sales were strong enough to prevent a “growth break” narrative. Net: BoC can ease, but the urgency is not accelerating — market should price a gradual path, not a rush.

What did not matter this week: low-frequency confidence/sentiment (GfK), stable policy holds (Norges/BoJ were expected), and single-point activity prints without confirmation (one-offs only mattered when clustered, like UK Friday).

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

Sweden — SEB Housing Price Indicator (Jan)
Actual 44.0 vs prior 37.0
Dominant signal: housing sentiment is re-accelerating at the margin — the rate-expectations channel is starting to work again into 2026.
Secondary: this reads as stabilisation plus mild reflation of housing risk appetite rather than a boom.
Noise: diffusion surveys swing with mortgage-rate headlines.
Reaction function: still second-order versus CPIF-XE, but it reduces comfort with an aggressive easing path if it feeds broader financial-conditions easing.
Transmission: SEK reacts only if markets translate this into “fewer / slower cuts”; otherwise this stays a domestic FCI barometer.

Sweden — SEB Housing Price “Increase” share (Jan)
Actual 52.0 vs prior 49.0
Dominant signal: breadth of optimism is widening — a marginal easing of financial conditions.
Secondary/noise: consistent with recovery, not overheating.
Reaction function: trims dovish urgency at the margin; subordinate to inflation prints.

Actual 8.0 vs prior 12.0
Dominant signal: downside tail in housing expectations is shrinking.
Secondary: lowers probability of a housing-led downside growth shock.

Transmission: front-end gilt bias lower; GBP impact second-order.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — BRC Retail Sales Monitor (Dec)
Like-for-like sales: +1.0% y/y vs +1.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumption momentum slowed into year-end; nominal growth is fading.

Reaction function: incremental dovish colour for the BoE; demand is not re-accelerating.
Transmission: mild bull-steepening impulse; limited FX impact.

Japan — Current Account (Nov)
NSA: ¥3.59tn vs ¥3.67tn prior
SA balance: ¥2.48tn

Canada — Leading Index (Dec)
Actual +0.26%
Dominant signal: forward momentum modest but positive.
Reaction function: neutral; not decisive vs labour market.

United Kingdom — MPC communications (Jan 14)
Dominant signal: one member framed trade diversion as structurally disinflationary, favouring a continued downward rate path conditional on data.
Secondary: conditional dovish guidance, not a commitment.
Reaction function: trims hawkish tail; does not override services/wage constraints.
Transmission: front-end sensitivity; GBP depends on relative-cut timing.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — GDP (Nov)
m/m: +0.3% vs +0.1% consensus
3m/3m: +0.1% vs -0.2% consensus

Dominant signal: housing stabilising, not recovering.
Reaction function: marginally hawkish vs housing-support rationale.

United Kingdom — BoE Credit Conditions Survey (Q4)
Dominant signal: credit availability still easing, but momentum slowing sharply.
Reaction function: supports gradual easing; financial conditions may not loosen as much as markets expect.

Sweden — CPI / CPIF suite (Dec)
All prints exactly in line with consensus.
Dominant signal: no new information; inflation firmly anchored.
Reaction function: policy becomes FCI- and activity-driven rather than inflation-driven.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

Canada — Housing Starts (Dec)
Actual 282k vs 260k consensus
Dominant signal: housing activity stronger than expected.
Secondary: contrasts with weak permits — volatility rather than trend shift.

MONDAY 5 — RELEASED

Japan — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 49.7 vs 50.0 consensus vs prior 49.7
Dominant signal: manufacturing remains in contraction and fails to recover into year-end; the miss versus consensus reinforces the view that Japan’s goods cycle is still a drag despite services resilience.
Secondary: the lack of upward revision confirms that late-2025 optimism around external demand was premature.
Noise: small headline miss magnitude; no new collapse signal.
Reaction function: keeps the BoJ constrained by weak real activity despite inflation optics.
Transmission: limits JPY support via growth expectations rather than inflation repricing.

Switzerland — Retail Sales (Nov, y/y)
Actual 2.7% vs 2.3% consensus vs 2.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumer demand remains resilient despite tight financial conditions.
Secondary: upside relative to consensus suggests households are still absorbing higher prices without a sharp pullback.

Transmission: supports CHF via growth resilience rather than policy repricing.

Switzerland — Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.7 vs 45.8 consensus
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise lifts PMI close to expansion threshold; manufacturing contraction is far less severe than feared.

Reaction function: lowers urgency for SNB dovish pivot driven by growth fears.
Transmission: supports CHF sentiment through improved cyclical optics.

United Kingdom — BoE Consumer Credit (Nov)
Actual £2.077bn vs £1.100bn consensus vs £0.977bn prior
Dominant signal: credit growth remains robust, indicating demand resilience despite restrictive policy.
Secondary: suggests financial conditions are not biting households as hard as expected.
Noise: monthly volatility in unsecured credit.
Reaction function: reinforces BoE caution on declaring victory over demand-driven inflation pressures.
Transmission: supports front-end rates via “restrictive but leaky” conditions.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Lending (Nov)
Actual £4.490bn vs £4.500bn consensus vs £4.156bn prior
Dominant signal: mortgage flows stabilising; housing is no longer a sharp drag.

Noise: small monthly fluctuations.
Reaction function: housing is not forcing BoE’s hand.
Transmission: limits downside risk premia in UK rates and GBP.

Dominant signal: pace of balance-sheet contraction is slowing.
Secondary: confirms gradual policy normalisation without active tightening.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: BoJ remains cautious; no urgency to tighten liquidity further.
Transmission: mildly supportive for JPY via reduced easing impulse, but secondary to growth.

United Kingdom — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.4 vs 52.1 consensus vs 52.0 prior
Dominant signal: services momentum cooled more than expected.

Transmission: caps upside in UK rates.

United Kingdom — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual $222,488.53m vs $224,754.48m consensus
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock than expected (flow/valuation mix can matter, but this is not a clean “intervention” tell without composition).
Secondary: in the current UK macro setup, this is second-order unless it coincides with stress episodes.
Noise: valuation effects dominate month-to-month.
Reaction function: none for BoE; this is not a domestic demand/inflation input.
Transmission: only relevant if markets start pricing external funding/BoP stress — not implied by this print alone.

Norway — Housing Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual 6.2% vs 5.0% consensus
Dominant signal: housing inflation re-accelerating sharply.
Secondary: indicates financial conditions remain accommodative domestically.
Noise: seasonal distortions.

Transmission: supports NOK via domestic demand and rate-differential channel.

New Zealand — Milk Auctions (6 Jan, w/e)
Actual 3,533 vs prior 3,533
Dominant signal: flat auction result — no new terms-of-trade impulse.
Secondary: stabilisation after prior volatility keeps NZ growth/income narrative unchanged.
Noise: auction-to-auction noise.
Reaction function: neutral for RBNZ at the margin.
Transmission: NZD impact muted.

WEDNESDAY 7 — RELEASED

Japan — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.5 vs 51.6 consensus
Dominant signal: services strength is materially better than expected.
Secondary: confirms two-speed economy — services offsetting manufacturing weakness.
Noise: survey optimism.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ’s patience; inflation-services linkage remains key.
Transmission: supports JPY via domestic demand resilience rather than policy shift.

Japan — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.5 vs 51.1 consensus

Headline m/m: 0.00% vs 0.30% consensus vs 0.00% prior
Headline y/y: 3.40% vs 3.70% consensus vs 3.80% prior
Trimmed mean m/m (SA): 0.30% vs 0.25% consensus vs 0.30% prior

Dominant signal: no clean February signal — headline disinflation is clear, but underlying is still in a “grey zone” (trimmed mean momentum not collapsing).
Secondary: trimmed mean deceleration (key ref: ~0.258% m/m on the trimmed mean) still leaves upside risk to the quarterly CPI forecast (~0.8% q/q); housing details are mixed (rents firmer, new dwellings softer), while discretionary services (restaurants/takeaways) look contained.
Noise: monthly CPI is composition-heavy and can mislead; the quarterly aggregate is the decision-grade input.
Reaction function: keeps both hike/hold on the table; the bar for a hike is not met by this print alone, but the bar for a “done” declaration isn’t met either.
Transmission: caps AUD directionality via front-end range-trading — policy debate stays live until the full-quarter CPI arrives.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, m/m)
Actual +15.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs -6.4% prior
Dominant signal: sharp rebound in construction approvals.
Secondary: housing activity may stabilise sooner than expected.
Noise: catch-up volatility.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish CPI impulse but clearly secondary.
Transmission: marginal support to growth expectations, but inflation dominates.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, y/y)
Actual +5.6% vs +4.4% consensus vs +6.4% prior
Dominant signal: approvals improving vs consensus but growth is not accelerating vs prior.
Secondary: points to stabilisation rather than re-boom.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: neutral for RBA at the margin.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Construction PMI (Dec)
Actual 40.1 vs 42.5 consensus vs 39.4 prior
Dominant signal: construction remains deeply contractionary.
Secondary: weak construction is consistent with late-cycle stagnation, but it’s not the BoE constraint.
Noise: sector-specific.
Reaction function: does not force easing; services/wages still dominate the BoE decision map.
Transmission: growth drag without immediate policy impact.

United Kingdom — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 50.1 vs 50.4 consensus
Dominant signal: economy barely expanding.
Secondary: reinforces late-cycle stagnation narrative.
Noise: small miss.

Transmission: negative CAD via growth expectations.

Canada — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.13 vs 9.12 prior
Dominant signal: essentially unchanged risk score.
Secondary/noise: low-frequency index; not a decision-grade macro input this week.
Reaction function: none.
Transmission: negligible.

THURSDAY 8 — RELEASED

Australia — Balance on Goods (Nov)
Actual A$2,936m vs A$4,900m consensus vs A$4,385m prior
Dominant signal: external surplus underwhelms materially; net trade impulse is weaker than expected into Q4 tracking.
Secondary: consistent with a softer export pulse and/or resilience in import demand; confirms AUD’s sensitivity to terms-of-trade and China-linked volume risk.
Noise: one month can swing with commodity pricing/shipments.
Reaction function: not an RBA trigger by itself, but it removes one “growth cushion” that would have made hawkishness easier to justify after the CPI grey zone.
Transmission: mildly AUD-negative through current-account/terms-of-trade optics; reduces upside convexity.

Australia — Exports (Nov)
Actual -2.9% vs +3.4% consensus vs +4.3% prior
Dominant signal: export momentum rolled over hard vs expectations.
Secondary: makes the weak trade balance more “real” (not just imports noise).
Reaction function: dovish-tilt at the margin via growth impulse, but secondary to quarterly CPI.
Transmission: AUD-negative via growth/earnings channel.

Australia — Imports (Nov)
Actual +0.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs +2.4% prior
Dominant signal: import demand cooler than expected — domestic demand not overheating.
Secondary: partially offsets the export weakness in net trade arithmetic, but not enough given the trade balance miss.
Noise: shipment timing.
Reaction function: marginally supports the “hold still plausible” interpretation post-CPI.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, m/m)
Actual -0.6% vs +0.2% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: housing prices softer than expected.
Secondary: confirms the housing channel is still rate-sensitive.
Noise: Halifax is noisy month-to-month.
Reaction function: marginally dovish at the margin but not decisive vs services inflation constraint.
Transmission: slightly easier UK front-end bias; GBP impact second-order.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual +0.3% vs +1.1% consensus vs +0.7% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside surprise underscores housing disinflation.
Secondary: weak price momentum can feed through to consumption confidence later, but lagged.
Noise: sample effects.
Reaction function: adds to the “growth is soft” pile, still not the binding constraint.
Transmission: same as above.

Sweden — CPI Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.3% vs 0.5% consensus vs 0.3% prior
Dominant signal: headline inflation remains very low.
Secondary: keeps the disinflation narrative intact.
Noise: headline is not the Riksbank constraint when CPIF is stable.
Reaction function: supports the easing bias if activity weakens further, but CPIF is the policy metric.
Transmission: SEK support limited; rates bias marginally dovish.

Sweden — CPIF Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.1% vs 2.5% consensus vs 2.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful downside surprise in the policy-relevant measure.
Secondary: suggests underlying inflation is converging faster than expected.
Noise: one flash print, but the direction matters.
Reaction function: strengthens the case that policy can lean dovish without risking a re-acceleration narrative.
Transmission: front-end rates down bias; SEK capped unless global risk helps.

Sweden — CPIF ex Energy Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.3% vs 2.6% consensus vs 2.4% prior
Dominant signal: downside in core-like measure confirms the CPIF surprise is not just energy noise.
Secondary: reduces hawkish tail risk.
Reaction function: dovish optionality rises.
Transmission: reinforces SEK-capping, rates-bullish impulse.

Norway — Manufacturing Output (Nov, m/m)
Actual +2.4% vs -0.9% consensus vs -1.3% prior
Dominant signal: sharp positive surprise — manufacturing is not rolling over despite tight policy.
Secondary: reduces near-term growth downside that would otherwise justify Norges easing.
Noise: volatile series.
Reaction function: supports “hold restrictive” bias, especially when paired with strong housing.
Transmission: NOK supportive via growth/rate differential expectations.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.0% vs -0.1% consensus vs -0.2% prior
Dominant signal: mild upside vs expectations; deflation risk not intensifying.
Secondary: confirms inflation remains extremely low but stable.
Noise: small monthly prints.
Reaction function: keeps SNB comfortable; no urgency either direction.
Transmission: CHF impact small.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: inflation barely positive; low-inflation regime persists.
Reaction function: SNB remains biased toward preventing CHF-driven undershoot, but no immediate catalyst from this print.
Transmission: CHF stays driven by global risk/rates more than domestic CPI.

Canada — Trade Balance (Oct, C$)
Actual -C$0.58bn vs -C$1.36bn consensus vs +C$0.15bn prior
Dominant signal: deficit smaller than feared, but still a deterioration vs prior surplus.
Secondary: narrows near-term growth downside a touch vs consensus.
Noise: commodity price/volume mix.
Reaction function: modestly reduces dovish pressure, but labour/inflation dominate BoC.
Transmission: CAD support is limited; the direction vs prior is still soft.

United Kingdom — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.01 vs 9.01 consensus
Dominant signal/noise: unchanged index; not decision-grade for BoE.
Reaction function/transmission: negligible.

FRIDAY 9 — RELEASED

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, y/y)
Actual +2.9% vs -0.9% consensus vs -2.9% prior (revised -2.3%)
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise in consumption — households are not retrenching as feared.
Secondary: could reflect bonus/seasonality effects, but the level of surprise matters for near-term demand tracking.
Noise: high volatility series.
Reaction function: raises the “services resilience” weight in the BoJ map; reduces the argument that weak manufacturing will quickly drag the whole economy.
Transmission: JPY marginally supported through growth expectations, not immediate policy repricing.

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, m/m)
Actual +6.2% vs +2.7% consensus vs -3.5% prior (revised +0.4%)
Dominant signal: acceleration in sequential momentum reinforces the y/y upside.
Secondary: reinforces the two-speed theme (strong domestic demand vs weak goods).
Reaction function/transmission: same as above.

New Zealand — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual 48,654m vs prior 55,852m
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock can reflect valuation/flow; not a clean stress/intervention signal alone.
Secondary: worth watching only if paired with funding stress or sharp NZD moves (not implied here).
Reaction function: none for RBNZ.
Transmission: limited.

Sweden — GDP (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.9% vs -0.3% consensus vs -0.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful upside growth surprise — activity is not as weak as priced.
Secondary: offsets some of the dovish impulse from the CPIF downside surprise; puts the onus back on inflation rather than growth.
Noise: single month volatility.
Reaction function: increases the probability Riksbank can ease more cautiously (inflation allows it, growth doesn’t force it).
Transmission: SEK ambiguity — inflation says dovish, activity says less urgency.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, y/y)
Actual +3.5% vs +3.6% consensus vs +3.8% prior
Dominant signal: still solid y/y but easing.
Secondary: consistent with “OK level, slowing momentum.”
Reaction function: neutral; GDP surprise carries more weight.
Transmission: minor.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.5% vs prior -1.4%
Dominant signal: rebound adds to the upside activity story.
Reaction function: marginally reduces urgency to ease aggressively.
Transmission: supports the “SEK not one-way weak” case, but still dominated by CPIF.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, y/y)
Actual +4.2% vs +5.9% consensus
Dominant signal: softer than expected on the y/y measure despite the GDP rebound — composition matters.
Secondary: suggests the GDP strength may be broader than industry-value alone (services/other components).
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: keeps the Riksbank able to focus on inflation.
Transmission: mixed.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, m/m)
Actual -0.1% vs prior -6.6% (revised -6.8%)
Dominant signal: stabilisation after a very weak prior month.
Secondary: supports the “activity is not collapsing” read.
Reaction function/transmission: secondary.

Norway — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus
Norway — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 3.2% vs 3.0% consensus vs 2.9% prior
Dominant signal: upside surprise on y/y re-anchors inflation persistence.
Secondary: strengthens the case that domestic inflation is sticky even as Europe disinflates.
Noise: monthly base effects, but direction matters for policy debate.
Reaction function: Norges easing optionality is pushed out; the bar for dovish signalling rises materially when inflation surprises up alongside strong housing and output.
Transmission: NOK-supportive via front-end repricing / higher-for-longer bias.
