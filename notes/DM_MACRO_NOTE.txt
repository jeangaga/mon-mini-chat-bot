DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 5–9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Wednesday close

MONDAY 5 — RELEASED

Japan — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 49.7 vs 50.0 consensus vs prior 49.7

Dominant signal: manufacturing remains in contraction and fails to recover into year-end; the miss versus consensus reinforces the view that Japan’s goods cycle is still a drag despite services resilience.
Secondary: the lack of upward revision confirms that late-2025 optimism around external demand was premature.
Noise: small headline miss magnitude; no new collapse signal.
Reaction function: keeps the BoJ constrained by weak real activity despite inflation optics.
Transmission: limits JPY support via growth expectations rather than inflation repricing.

Switzerland — Retail Sales (Nov, y/y)
Actual 2.7% vs 2.3% consensus vs 2.2% prior

Dominant signal: consumer demand remains resilient despite tight financial conditions.
Secondary: upside relative to consensus suggests households are still absorbing higher prices without a sharp pullback.
Noise: single-month volatility.
Reaction function: marginally reduces downside growth risk but not enough to alter SNB disinflation focus.
Transmission: supports CHF via growth resilience rather than policy repricing.

Switzerland — Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.7 vs 45.8 consensus

Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise lifts PMI close to expansion threshold; manufacturing contraction is far less severe than feared.
Secondary: suggests external demand weakness may be stabilising rather than accelerating.
Noise: survey volatility after deep pessimism.
Reaction function: lowers urgency for SNB dovish pivot driven by growth fears.
Transmission: supports CHF sentiment through improved cyclical optics.

United Kingdom — BoE Consumer Credit (Nov)
Actual £2.08bn vs £1.10bn consensus vs £0.98bn prior

Dominant signal: credit growth remains robust, indicating demand resilience despite restrictive policy.
Secondary: suggests financial conditions are not biting households as hard as expected.
Noise: monthly volatility in unsecured credit.
Reaction function: reinforces BoE caution on declaring victory over demand-driven inflation pressures.
Transmission: supports front-end rates via “restrictive but leaky” conditions.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Lending (Nov)
Actual £4.49bn vs £4.50bn consensus vs £4.27bn prior

Dominant signal: mortgage flows stabilising; housing is no longer a sharp drag.
Secondary: consistent with gradual adjustment rather than collapse.
Noise: marginal miss vs consensus.
Reaction function: neutral for BoE; does not argue for early easing.
Transmission: stabilises housing-related growth expectations.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Approvals (Nov)
Actual 64.5k vs 64.4k consensus vs 65.0k prior

Dominant signal: housing demand holding steady.
Secondary: supports the view that rate sensitivity has plateaued.
Noise: small monthly fluctuations.
Reaction function: housing is not forcing BoE’s hand.
Transmission: limits downside risk premia in UK rates and GBP.

Australia — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.0 vs 51.1 consensus

Dominant signal: services expansion intact but not accelerating.
Secondary: confirms moderate domestic demand.
Noise: trivial miss.
Reaction function: neutral for RBA.
Transmission: none material.

Australia — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.1 vs 51.0 consensus

Transmission: stabilises AUD growth narrative.

TUESDAY 6 — RELEASED

Japan — Monetary Base (Dec, y/y)
Actual -8.66% vs -9.81% prior

Dominant signal: pace of balance-sheet contraction is slowing.
Secondary: confirms gradual policy normalisation without active tightening.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: BoJ remains cautious; no urgency to tighten liquidity further.
Transmission: mildly supportive for JPY via reduced easing impulse, but secondary to growth.

United Kingdom — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.4 vs 52.1 consensus vs 52.0 prior

Dominant signal: services momentum cooled more than expected.
Secondary: signals some sensitivity to restrictive policy.
Noise: survey revision risk.
Reaction function: introduces mild downside growth optionality but does not override inflation concerns.
Transmission: softens GBP growth support; modest front-end relief.

United Kingdom — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.4 vs 52.1 consensus vs 51.9 prior

Transmission: caps upside in UK rates.

Norway — Housing Prices (Dec, y/y)

Dominant signal: housing inflation re-accelerating sharply.
Secondary: indicates financial conditions remain accommodative domestically.
Noise: seasonal distortions.
Reaction function: strengthens Norges Bank’s reluctance to ease.

WEDNESDAY 7 — RELEASED

Actual 52.5 vs 51.6 consensus

Dominant signal: services strength is materially better than expected.
Secondary: confirms two-speed economy — services offsetting manufacturing weakness.
Noise: survey optimism.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ’s patience; inflation-services linkage remains key.
Transmission: supports JPY via domestic demand resilience rather than policy shift.

Japan — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.5 vs 51.1 consensus

Dominant signal: overall activity stronger than feared.
Secondary: supports “no hard landing” narrative.
Noise: survey breadth.
Reaction function: neutral-to-supportive for gradual normalisation.
Transmission: modestly JPY-supportive.

Australia — CPI (Nov)
Headline y/y: 3.4% vs 3.7% consensus vs 3.8% prior  
Trimmed mean m/m: 0.258% vs ~0.30% consensus vs 0.33% prior

Dominant signal: disinflation continues but lands squarely in a grey zone; the trimmed mean decelerated from October but remains firm enough to keep upside risk to the RBA’s quarterly CPI forecast (~0.8% q/q).
Secondary: housing components are mixed — rents accelerated to +0.4% m/m (strongest since Feb-25), while new dwelling prices slowed to +0.5% m/m from +0.7% previously; services inflation (restaurants/takeaways) remains contained.
Noise: monthly CPI volatility and composition effects.
Reaction function: no clear signal for the February meeting; both a hike and a hold remain live options, with the data insufficient to force the RBA’s hand ahead of the full-quarter print.
Transmission: caps AUD upside via rates repricing; keeps front-end expectations range-bound.

Bottom-line (AUS CPI): November does not break the debate. RBA deliberations stay on the fence until the full quarter is available; current data are still consistent with an on-hold bias. No change in view.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, m/m)
Actual +15.2% vs 2.0% consensus vs -6.4% prior

Dominant signal: sharp rebound in construction approvals.
Secondary: housing activity may stabilise sooner than expected.
Noise: catch-up volatility.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish CPI impulse but clearly secondary.
Transmission: marginal support to growth expectations, but inflation dominates.

United Kingdom — Construction PMI (Dec)
Actual 40.1 vs 42.5 consensus vs 39.4 prior

Dominant signal: construction remains deeply contractionary.
Secondary: housing and infrastructure still weak.
Noise: sector-specific.
Reaction function: not decisive for BoE; services inflation still dominates.
Transmission: growth drag without immediate policy impact.

United Kingdom — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 50.1 vs 50.4 consensus

Dominant signal: economy barely expanding.
Secondary: reinforces late-cycle stagnation narrative.
Noise: small miss.
Reaction function: supports “higher for longer but closer to inflection”.
Transmission: keeps GBP range-bound.

Canada — Ivey PMI (Dec)
Actual 44.5 vs 43.3 consensus

Dominant signal: activity remains contractionary but slightly less weak than feared.
Secondary: domestic demand still soft.
Noise: survey volatility.
Reaction function: neutral for BoC; no inflation signal.
Transmission: limited CAD impact.

Canada — Ivey PMI SA (Dec)
Actual 48.4 vs 51.9 consensus

Dominant signal: underlying momentum weaker than expected.
Secondary: confirms growth slowdown.
Noise: adjustment issues.
Reaction function: marginally dovish bias preserved.
Transmission: negative CAD via growth expectations.
