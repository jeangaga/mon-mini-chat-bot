MAJOR EVENTS — WEEK 2

TUESDAY 04 FEB — RELEASED

AUSTRALIA — RBA Interest Rate Decision (Feb meeting)
• Actual: 3.85% HIKE 25bp vs 3.60% vs Consensus: 3.85%
• Vote: UNANIMOUS (9-0)

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated):
→ RBA Governor Michele Bullock: "Recent run of data gives Board clear-enough view that underlying momentum of inflation is too strong. We updated assessment/outlook and concluded rate no longer at right level to get inflation back to target in reasonable timeframe. Based on data, Board thinks it will take longer for inflation to return to target - this is NOT acceptable outcome."
→ Bullock on Q4 inflation: "Inflation in Q4 was 'materially higher' than expected, partly due to less persistent factors. Private demand growth much stronger than expected in H2 2025. Economy judged further from balance than assumed, growing above potential. Some indicators suggest financial conditions may now be 'somewhat accommodative'."
→ Bullock on forward path: "Cannot allow inflation to get away from us again. Did not discuss 50bp rise. Board will be cautious on rates. Seeing some tightening in financial conditions through A$. Rising A$ helpful at margin. Do not know if this will be tightening cycle. Can't rule anything in or out. Board will actively monitor data."
→ RBA forecasts (Statement on Monetary Policy): "Assumes cash rate 3.9% by June, 4.2% by Dec (implies 1-2 more hikes). Trimmed mean inflation 3.7% Q2, 3.2% Q4 2026, 2.7% Q4 2027. GDP growth 2.3% Q4 2025, 1.8% Q4 2026. Unemployment 4.3% Q4 2026."
→ Westpac Economist: "RBA forecasts imply quarterly trimmed mean ~0.9% for next two quarters before reverting to 0.7%. At 3.2% annual trimmed mean still above target at end-2026. Beyond mid-year, temporary elements expected to unwind and restrictive policy to dampen inflation, returning close to mid-point 2.5% by mid-2028."
→ NAB Chief Economist Sally Auld: "Another hike likely in May. Risk of March hike or 50bp increase."
→ Markets: "AUD/USD retook 0.7000, up 0.75% on decision. 3yr yields jumped 8bp to 4.30%. Investors price ~75% probability follow-up May hike. Markets expect additional 40bp tightening total this year."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: RBA DELIVERED hike as expected, but FORWARD GUIDANCE is more hawkish than market anticipated. The CRITICAL shift: RBA's own forecasts NOW ASSUME cash rate 4.2% by Dec 2026 (vs 3.85% current) = implies 1-2 MORE hikes baked into their inflation path. Bullock's "underlying momentum too strong" + "not acceptable" timeframe language = Board COMMITTED to further tightening unless inflation cooperates immediately. Combined with UNANIMOUS vote (no dissent, vs some prior meetings had 1-2 dissenters), this signals RBA Board is FULLY ALIGNED on hawkish path.

Secondary: The RBA's assessment that "financial conditions somewhat accommodative" despite cash rate 3.60% (pre-hike) is REGIME-DEFINING. This means: (a) Credit growth too strong ("picked up sharply"), (b) AUD appreciation helping but not enough, (c) Housing market "continuing to pick up", (d) Private demand "strengthened substantially more than expected". All point to economy OVERHEATING not cooling, which justifies ongoing tightening.

Noise: Bullock's "didn't discuss 50bp" comment is somewhat reassuring (no panic mode), but doesn't change base case of 2-3 more 25bp hikes

Reaction-function impact (RBA): **HIKING CYCLE CONFIRMED.** Forward path: March HOLD (assess Feb hike transmission), May HIKE 25bp to 4.10%, August possible 3rd hike to 4.35%, then PAUSE. Terminal rate 4.10-4.35% (vs prior market expectations ~3.85% one-and-done). Triggers for MORE hikes: (a) Q1 trimmed mean >0.9% QQ (annualizes >3.6%), (b) Unemployment <4.0% (tightening not loosening), (c) Private credit growth >6.0% YY (currently elevated). Triggers for PAUSE after Feb: (a) Q1 trimmed mean <0.6% QQ (disinflation resuming), (b) Unemployment >4.5% (labor market cracking), (c) Housing prices falling >5% (wealth effect reversing).

Transmission: **AUD STRONGEST G10 CURRENCY.** RBA is ONLY major DM central bank in hiking cycle (Fed holding 4.50% but NOT hiking further; BoJ paused 0.75%; BoE/BoC/Riksbank/SNB cutting). AUD/USD 0.70 → 0.72-0.75 by Q2 2026 if RBA delivers 2-3 hikes as expected. AUD/JPY especially explosive (RBA hiking vs BoJ paused): 100 → 108-112. AUD/CAD strong (RBA hiking vs BoC cutting): current ~1.00 → 1.05-1.08. Australia rates: 3yr swap 4.30% → 4.60-4.80% (pricing full hiking cycle). 10yr bond 4.50% → 4.70-4.90% (term premium rising as RBA tightens while Fed holds). Australia equity (ASX200) VULNERABLE near-term: (a) Banks benefit (NIM expansion) but offset by (b) REITs/utilities hurt (higher discount rates), (c) Consumer discretionary hurt (rate hikes dampen spending), (d) Resources supported (commodity boom + China stimulus). Net effect: ASX range-bound, underperform global equities.

Regime comparison: Australia is now the ANTI-CONSENSUS DM economy - hiking while world cuts/pauses, domestic demand booming while others stagnating, inflation rising while others disinflating. This creates **MAXIMUM G10 FX DISPERSION** and makes AUD the cleanest "DM carry + growth + commodity" triple-play trade.

WEDNESDAY 05 FEB — RELEASED

NEW ZEALAND — Unemployment Rate (Q4)
• Actual: 5.4% vs 5.3% Prior

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: NZ unemployment 5.4% vs 5.3% = RISING (labor market weakening). This confirms RBNZ easing cycle justified - growth weak, labor loosening, inflation falling toward target.

Secondary: Australia-NZ divergence MAXIMUM - Aus unemployment 4.1% falling (tightening), NZ 5.4% rising (loosening). RBA hiking, RBNZ cutting.

Reaction-function impact (RBNZ): Cuts continue (repo currently ~3.50%), likely 25bp Feb, terminal 2.50-2.75% by Q3 2026.

Transmission: NZD WEAKER than AUD - labor weakening + RBNZ cutting vs RBA hiking = AUD/NZD 1.10 → 1.15-1.18 by Q2.

THURSDAY 06 FEB — RELEASED

UK — BoE Interest Rate Decision (Feb meeting)
• Actual: 3.75% HOLD vs Consensus: 3.75%
• Vote: 4-5 (4 for hold, 5 for cut) vs Prior: 5-4 (5 for hold, 4 for cut)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: BoE hold 3.75% as expected, but MPC VOTE SHIFTED 4-5 from prior 5-4 = MORE DOVISH. One member flipped from "hold" to "cut" camp, signaling easing bias strengthening. This suggests BoE will CUT 25bp in March/April as majority coalesces toward easing.

Secondary: UK growth soft landing narrative intact - inflation falling toward 2.0% target, growth moderate (not collapsing), labor market cooling gradually.

Reaction-function impact (BoE): Next cut March (25bp to 3.50%), then May (to 3.25%), terminal 3.00-3.25% by end-2026. BoE easing will be GRADUAL (25bp quarterly) not aggressive (unlike BoC/Riksbank).

Transmission: GBP neutral-to-weak - BoE cutting but SLOWER than peers (BoC terminal 1.50-1.75%, Riksbank 1.50%, BoE 3.00-3.25%) = GBP holds up vs CAD/SEK but weak vs AUD/USD. GBP/USD 1.25-1.28 range. GBP/AUD weakens (BoE cuts vs RBA hikes): 1.80 → 1.72-1.75.

---

THURSDAY 06 FEB — RELEASED

CANADA — Employment Change (Jan)
• Actual: -24.8k vs +7.0k Consensus (MAJOR MISS)
• Unemployment: 6.5% (unchanged, only due to participation drop)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Canada employment -24.8k vs +7.0k consensus = **32k MISS**, confirming labor market CRACKING. This is NOT a one-off - follows prior months of weak job creation and GDP stall (Week 1: 0.0% MM). Unemployment 6.5% unchanged only because participation rate FELL (people leaving labor force, not finding jobs). This is LABOR MARKET RECESSION signal.

Secondary: Canada-US labor divergence widening (US payrolls still +150-200k/month, Canada negative)

Reaction-function impact (BoC): **MARCH CUT 25BP CERTAIN** (to 2.00%), April another 25bp (to 1.75%), terminal 1.50% by Q3 2026. BoC will cut REGARDLESS of Fed because labor market collapsing justifies easing.

Transmission: **CAD MOST VULNERABLE G10.** Labor crack (-24.8k) + BoC cutting aggressively (terminal 1.50%) + growth stalling (GDP 0.0%) = CAD/USD 1.43 → 1.48-1.52 by Q2 2026. CAD weakest vs AUD (RBA hiking vs BoC cutting): CAD/AUD 1.00 → 0.92-0.95 (AUD/CAD 1.00 → 1.05-1.08).

---

SWEDEN — CPI Flash (Jan)
• CPIF ex-energy: 1.7% vs 1.9% Consensus (major disinflation)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Sweden CPI ex-energy 1.7% vs 1.9% consensus = disinflation accelerating, below Riksbank 2.0% target.

Reaction-function impact (Riksbank): Confirms aggressive cutting (terminal 1.50%).

Transmission: SEK WEAKEST NORDICS, SEK/EUR 11.50-11.80.

CROSS-DM SYNTHESIS — WEEK 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEME: **RBA HIKING CYCLE ISOLATION + BoE/BoC DOVISH ACCELERATION**

**THE GREAT DM DIVERGENCE:**

Week 2 confirms Australia is in a LEAGUE OF ITS OWN among DM central banks:

**HIKING (Tightening Cycle):**
- **Australia RBA:** 3.85% → 4.10-4.35% terminal (2-3 more hikes)
   - Reasoning: Inflation 3.4% trimmed mean above target, private demand booming, labor tight 4.1%
   - Forecast: May hike 25bp, August possible 3rd hike

**PAUSING (On Hold):**
- **US Fed:** 4.50% (holding, no cuts until data forces it)
- **Japan BoJ:** 0.75% (next hike Oct 2026, Tokyo CPI 2.0% at target removes urgency)

**CUTTING (Easing Cycles Active/Imminent):**
- **Canada BoC:** 2.25% → 1.50-1.75% terminal (jobs -24.8k, GDP stalling)
- **UK BoE:** 3.75% → 3.00-3.25% terminal (MPC vote shifted dovish 4-5)
- **Sweden Riksbank:** 2.25% → 1.50% terminal (GDP miss, CPI below target)
- **Switzerland SNB:** Dovish (growth concerns)
- **New Zealand RBNZ:** Cutting (unemployment 5.4% rising)

**CENTRAL BANK POLICY RATE SPREAD (Current → Terminal):**
- RBA: 3.85% → 4.10-4.35% (**+25 to +50bp**)
- Fed: 4.50% → 4.50% (**unchanged**)
- BoJ: 0.75% → 1.00-1.25% by end-2027 (**+25bp gradual**)
- BoE: 3.75% → 3.00-3.25% (**-50 to -75bp**)
- BoC: 2.25% → 1.50-1.75% (**-50 to -75bp**)
- Riksbank: 2.25% → 1.50% (**-75bp**)

**DM FX HIERARCHY (Updated Post-Week 2):**

**TIER 1 — STRONG APPRECIATION:**
→ **AUD (STRONGEST):** RBA hiking 3.85% → 4.10-4.35%, only DM hiker, commodity support, China tailwind, private demand booming
→ **CHF:** SNB dovish but safe-haven bid, EUR weakness supports CHF

**TIER 2 — NEUTRAL/STABLE:**
→ **USD:** Fed holding 4.50%, no cuts near-term, but global slowdown risk caps upside
→ **JPY:** BoJ paused 0.75%, safe-haven bid offsets dovish policy, intervention support 160 level

**TIER 3 — MODERATE WEAKNESS:**
→ **GBP:** BoE cutting 3.75% → 3.00-3.25%, but GRADUAL (slower than BoC/Riksbank), soft landing intact
→ **NZD:** RBNZ cutting, unemployment 5.4% rising, but less aggressive than Sweden/Canada

**TIER 4 — STRONG DEPRECIATION:**
→ **CAD (WEAKEST):** BoC cutting to 1.50-1.75% + jobs -24.8k labor crack + GDP 0.0% stalling = triple negative
→ **SEK:** Riksbank aggressive cuts to 1.50%, GDP miss, CPI below target

**DM RATES CURVES (Steepening vs Flattening):**

**STEEPENING (Hiking = Curve Bear Flattening):**
- **Australia:** 2yr 3.80% → 4.40%, 10yr 4.50% → 4.80% (2s10s spread narrows as front-end reprices hikes)

**FLATTENING (Cutting = Curve Bull Steepening):**
- **Canada:** 2yr 2.60% → 1.80%, 10yr 3.20% → 3.00% (2s10s spread widens as front-end cuts price in)
- **UK:** 2yr 4.00% → 3.40%, 10yr 4.50% → 4.20% (gradual cuts)
- **Sweden:** 2yr 2.00% → 1.50%, 10yr 2.50% → 2.30% (aggressive cuts)

**CROSS-DM TRADES (Updated):**

**HIGHEST CONVICTION:**
1. **Long AUD / Short CAD:** "Hike vs Labor Crack" — RBA 3.85% → 4.35% vs BoC 2.25% → 1.50%, jobs -24.8k vs Aus labor tight 4.1%, GDP 0.0% vs Aus private demand booming. AUD/CAD 1.00 → 1.08-1.10.

2. **Long AUD / Short JPY:** "Hike vs Pause" — RBA hiking cycle vs BoJ Oct 2026 next hike. AUD/JPY 100 → 110-112.

3. **Long AUD / Short SEK:** "Strong vs Weak" — RBA hiking vs Riksbank aggressive cuts, commodity boom vs manufacturing stall.

**MEDIUM CONVICTION:**
4. **Long GBP / Short CAD:** "Gradual vs Aggressive" — BoE -50bp vs BoC -75bp, UK soft landing vs Canada labor crack.

5. **Long USD / Short CAD:** "Hold vs Cut" — Fed 4.50% steady vs BoC 2.25% → 1.50%, Canada vulnerable.

**AVOID:**
- **Short AUD** (RBA hiking + commodity + China = fundamentals too strong)
- **Long CAD** (triple negative: jobs crack + BoC aggressive cuts + GDP stall)
- **Long SEK** (Riksbank aggressive + GDP miss)

**REGIME SHIFT SUMMARY:**

**PRIOR REGIME (Post-Week 1):**
"DM divergence at maximum — RBA solo hawk (hike Feb 4 certain); BoJ pause extends; BoC/Riksbank aggressive doves"

**UPDATED REGIME (Post-Week 2):**
**"RBA HIKING CYCLE CONFIRMED (3.85%, terminal 4.10-4.35%, May + Aug hikes coming); BoE DOVISH SHIFT (MPC 4-5, March cut likely); Canada LABOR CRACK (jobs -24.8k = BoC March cut certain, terminal 1.50%); DM CB divergence HISTORICAL MAXIMUM (RBA only hiker globally, tightening while all others pause/cut); AUD CLEANEST G10 LONG (hike + commodity + China + growth); CAD CLEANEST G10 SHORT (labor collapse + aggressive cuts + GDP stall)."**

**REGIME TRIGGERS:**

**BULLISH (DM convergence, AUD weakens):**
→ **Australia INFLATION COLLAPSE:** Q1 trimmed mean <0.5% QQ = RBA forced to pause/cut, AUD crashes to 0.65
→ **China HARD LANDING:** PMI <46, commodity crash (iron ore <$80) = AUD loses support
→ **RBA DOVISH SURPRISE:** March statement signals "one-and-done", markets reprice terminal 3.85% = AUD falls 3-5%

**BEARISH (DM divergence widens, AUD strengthens further):**
→ **Australia WAGES SPIKE:** Q1 wage price index >4.5% = RBA forced into 50bp hikes, terminal 4.50%+, AUD to 0.75+
→ **Canada RECESSION:** Q1 GDP negative + unemployment >7.0% = BoC panic cuts 50bp, CAD to 1.55+
→ **Fed DOVISH PIVOT:** 50bp March cut = USD weakens, AUD/USD to 0.75+

**NEUTRAL (Status quo extends):**
→ RBA delivers 2 more hikes (May + Aug) to 4.35% as forecast
→ BoC cuts to 1.75% as expected
→ BoE gradual cuts to 3.25%
→ Current FX hierarchy stable through H1 2026

WEEK 1 SUMMARY (JAN 26-30, 2026): AUSTRALIA HIKE SETUP VS JAPAN DISINFLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOMINANT THEME: Australia trimmed mean Q4 0.9% QQ (vs 0.8% consensus) = ALL CORE MEASURES BEAT → RBA hike Week 2 certain; Japan Tokyo CPI 2.0% (vs 2.2% consensus) = disinflation surprise → BoJ pause extends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR EVENTS — DETAILED HF COMMENTARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THURSDAY 29 JAN — RELEASED

AUSTRALIA — CPI Q4 2025
• Headline: 3.8% YY (Monthly Dec: 3.8% vs 3.4% Nov)
• Trimmed Mean: 0.9% QQ vs 0.8% Consensus, 3.4% YY vs 3.2% prior
• All core measures BEAT consensus

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ RBA Governor Michele Bullock (Feb 4 Week 2 press conference, provides context): "Inflation in Q4 was 'materially higher' than expected. Private demand growth much stronger than expected in H2 2025. Economy judged to be further from balance than assumed, growing above potential. Some indicators suggest financial conditions may now be 'somewhat accommodative'. Total credit growth has picked up sharply, cash rate below some measures of neutral."
→ FXStreet (Feb 4 context): "December monthly CPI leaped to 3.8% from 3.4% in November, above forecasts of 3.6%. Trimmed mean CPI rose 0.9% quarterly in Q4, beating market forecasts of 0.8%. Following hot inflation, money markets implied 73% probability of rate hike vs 60% previously. Australia's big four banks (ANZ, Westpac, CBA, NAB) altered call, forecasting 25bp RBA rate hike."
→ CBA Chief Economist Luke Yeaman (Nov 2025 context): "Inflation surprised us all in Sep quarter - trimmed mean jumped 1.0% quarterly. We have lifted trimmed mean forecast for Q4 to 0.8% (from 0.6%). This is one key reason we don't expect rate cuts near-term. Even if not at full capacity, annual trimmed mean will be too high for RBA Board to be comfortable cutting."
→ NAB Economist (context): "RBA's preference for trimmed mean inflation has long history. Trimmed means tend to outperform headline and exclusion-based 'core' measures on range of criteria. RBA's unusual focus on trimmed mean reflects this."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Australia trimmed mean 0.9% QQ vs 0.8% consensus = BEAT on RBA's PRIMARY INFLATION GAUGE. This is CRITICAL because: (a) RBA explicitly targets trimmed mean (not headline), (b) 0.9% QQ annualizes to 3.6%+ (well above 2-3% target range midpoint 2.5%), (c) Governor Bullock WARNED in Dec "if data suggests inflation not slowing, will be considered at Feb board meeting" → this IS that data. Combined with Bullock's Feb 4 assessment that Q4 inflation "materially higher than expected" + economy "further from balance" + "financial conditions somewhat accommodative" + "credit growth picked up sharply" = HIKE CERTAIN.

Secondary: ALL core measures beat (not just trimmed mean) - monthly CPI 3.8% vs 3.4% prior + 3.6% consensus, confirming broadbased inflation persistence. This is NOT energy/food volatility, it's domestic demand overheating (CBA: "private demand growth much stronger than expected H2 2025").

Noise: Q4 includes some seasonal patterns, but 0.9% vs 0.8% beat is meaningful not statistical

Reaction-function impact (RBA): Feb 4 hike 25bp to 3.85% from 3.60% is CERTAIN (occurred Week 2 - confirmed by Bullock statement). Forward path: RBA will likely hike AGAIN in March/April if: (a) Q1 2026 trimmed mean >0.8% QQ, (b) Labor market stays tight (unemployment <4.3%), (c) Credit growth continues (already "picked up sharply"). Terminal rate likely 4.10-4.35% (2-3 more 25bp hikes) before pause. This makes RBA THE ONLY MAJOR DM CENTRAL BANK HIKING in early 2026 (Fed holding 4.50%, ECB cutting to 2.00%, BoE cutting to 3.75%, BoJ paused 0.75%, BoC cutting to 2.25%).

Transmission: AUD STRONGEST DM FX on fundamentals - only central bank hiking + commodity support (iron ore, LNG) + China stimulus tailwind. AUD/USD 0.65 → 0.68-0.70 by Q2 2026 if RBA hikes 2-3 times as expected. AUD/JPY especially strong (RBA hiking vs BoJ paused). Australia rates: 3yr swap likely 3.60% → 4.00%+ as markets price hiking cycle. Australia equity (ASX200) vulnerable to: (a) Higher rates (REITs, utilities hurt), (b) Consumer slowdown (discretionary), but supported by: (c) Banks (NIM expansion from hiking cycle), (d) Resources (commodity boom).

Regime trigger: If trimmed mean Q1 2026 >1.0% QQ (4.0%+ annualized), RBA FORCED into 50bp hike or accelerated hiking pace (4-5 hikes total to 4.50%+). Threshold: Unemployment <4.0% + trimmed mean >1.0% QQ = RBA panic mode (inflation out of control).

FRIDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED

JAPAN — Tokyo CPI (Jan, leading indicator for national)
• Headline: 2.0% YY vs 2.2% Consensus vs 2.4% Prior (Dec)
• Core (ex-fresh food): 2.3% vs 2.5% prior
• Core-core (ex-fresh food & energy): 2.6% vs 2.8% prior

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ BoJ Outlook Report (Jan 23): "Year-on-year CPI (ex-fresh food) likely to decelerate to level below 2% in H1 2026, with waning effects of rise in food prices (rice) and partly due to government measures to address rising prices. However, mechanism in which wages and prices rise moderately in interaction will be maintained, underlying CPI inflation will continue rising moderately."
→ ING Economist: "Headline inflation eased to 2.0% in Tokyo December, below expectations (vs 2.7% Nov, 2.3% consensus), mainly due to renewed energy subsidies, stable rice prices, low petroleum costs. These factors expected to keep inflation low into 2026. Core inflation ex-fresh food & energy slowed to 2.6% (vs 2.8% Nov). With headline expected to drop below 2.0% and core easing toward 2.0%, BoJ likely to carefully assess impact of previous rate hikes before considering further hikes."
→ BoJ Governor Ueda (Dec 19 context): "BoJ would need to check impact of rate change each time before moving again." Signals data-dependent approach, no preset hiking path.
→ ING Forecast: "We expect BoJ's next rate hike in October 2026 (not Q1/Q2). However, if JPY weakens and drives up import prices, timeline could be moved forward to Q2 2026."
→ CNBC Analysis: "Tokyo CPI 2.0% is AT BoJ's 2% target, lowest since March 2022. Core-core 2.9% down from 3.0% is key - this strips food/energy volatility. Food inflation fell to 5.1% from 6.1% (13-month low), driven by slowest rice price rise in 16 months."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Tokyo CPI 2.0% = AT BOJ TARGET for first time since March 2022, and 20bp BELOW consensus (2.2%). This is a MAJOR DISINFLATION SURPRISE that removes urgency for BoJ to hike near-term. CRITICAL: Tokyo is leading indicator for national CPI (released ~1 week earlier), so Tokyo 2.0% signals national CPI will also fall toward/below 2.0% in Jan. Combined with BoJ's own forecast ("CPI likely below 2% H1 2026 due to waning rice prices + government energy subsidies"), this confirms BoJ PAUSE extends through Q1 2026 minimum.

Secondary: Core-core (ex-fresh food & energy) 2.6% vs 2.8% prior is the KEY measure for underlying inflation - this strips volatile components and shows TRUE demand-driven inflation. 2.6% is still ABOVE 2.0% target but FALLING (from 2.8%), which suggests "wages-prices interaction" (BoJ's goal for sustainable inflation) is WEAKENING not strengthening. This contradicts BoJ's hope that "wage-price loop will be maintained" and argues for LONGER pause.

Noise: January seasonal effects (energy subsidies renewed, rice prices seasonal), but magnitude of miss (2.0% vs 2.2% consensus) is meaningful

Reaction-function impact (BoJ): Next hike pushed to Q4 2026 (October per ING forecast) from prior market expectations of Q1-Q2 2026. BoJ will need to see: (a) Headline CPI ABOVE 2.0% for sustained period (not below), (b) Core-core ABOVE 2.5% (wage-price loop accelerating not decelerating), (c) Spring wage negotiations (shunto) deliver 5%+ raises (major unions targeting this, but delivery uncertain), (d) JPY stability (if JPY weakens to >155 vs USD, import price pressure could force earlier hike). Terminal rate likely 1.00-1.25% by end-2027 (from current 0.75%), very gradual path.

Transmission: JPY WEAKENING pressure near-term (BoJ pause extends while Fed holding 4.50% = rate differential persists). JPY likely 152-157 range vs USD in Q1 2026 (from current ~155). If BoJ signals "no hike until October" explicitly, JPY could test 160+ (intervention risk from MoF at that level). Japan equity (Nikkei/Topix) SUPPORTED by: (a) BoJ pause = easy financial conditions, (b) JPY weakness = export competitiveness, (c) Wage growth (even if 5%+ not achieved, 3-4% still solid), but VULNERABLE to: (d) Global slowdown (export demand), (e) China weakness (trade channel).

Regime comparison: Japan vs Australia is MAXIMUM DM MONETARY DIVERGENCE - RBA hiking to 3.85%+ (inflation 3.4% trimmed mean above target) while BoJ pausing at 0.75% (inflation 2.0% at target falling). AUD/JPY is cleanest DM carry trade: long AUD (hiking + commodity support) vs short JPY (paused + weak). AUD/JPY 99 → 105-108 by Q2 2026.

WEDNESDAY 29 JAN — RELEASED

CANADA — BoC Interest Rate Decision (Jan meeting)
• Actual: 2.25% HOLD vs Consensus: 2.25%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: BoC hold 2.25% as expected after aggressive easing cycle (5.00% peak → 2.25% = 275bp cuts). This is a TACTICAL PAUSE to assess transmission, not end of easing cycle. Forward guidance likely signals cuts resume in Q2 2026 if: (a) Inflation stays <2.5%, (b) Labor market continues softening (unemployment rising, job creation weak).

Secondary: BoC has cut MORE than Fed (275bp vs Fed's 100bp from peak), creating Canada-US rate spread compression (BoC 2.25% vs Fed 4.50% = -225bp, vs historical avg ~-50bp). This creates CAD weakness pressure.

Reaction-function impact (BoC): Next cut likely April (25bp to 2.00%), then June (to 1.75%), terminal rate 1.50-1.75% by end-2026. BoC will cut REGARDLESS of Fed because: (a) Canada growth weaker than US, (b) Canada housing market more rate-sensitive, (c) Canada labor market softer.

Transmission: CAD vulnerable - rate differential widening (BoC cutting, Fed holding) = CAD/USD likely 1.45-1.48 by mid-2026 (from current ~1.43). Canada rates: 2yr swap 2.25% → 1.60-1.80% as markets price easing path.

---

CANADA — GDP (Nov)
• Monthly: 0.0% MM vs 0.1% Consensus vs -0.1% Prior

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Canada GDP 0.0% MM = STALL after Oct -0.1% contraction. Two consecutive months of zero/negative growth signals Canada in SOFT RECESSION or at best stagnation. This CONFIRMS BoC easing bias - if growth not accelerating, BoC will cut further to stimulate.

Secondary: Canada-US growth divergence widening (US GDP ~2.5-3.0% vs Canada ~1.0-1.5% = 150bp gap, largest since COVID)

Reaction-function impact (BoC): GDP stall reinforces April cut certainty (25bp)

Transmission: CAD weakness confirmed - growth stalling + BoC cutting = double negative for CAD

---

WEDNESDAY 29 JAN — RELEASED

SWEDEN — GDP Q4 (preliminary)
• Actual: 0.2% QQ vs 0.6% Consensus vs 0.3% Prior (Q3)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Sweden GDP 0.2% vs 0.6% consensus = MAJOR MISS (40bp below expectations). This is FOURTH consecutive quarter of sub-1.0% growth, confirming Sweden in PROLONGED STAGNATION despite Riksbank aggressive easing (repo 2.25% from 4.00% peak = 175bp cuts).

Secondary: Sweden inflation already low (CPI ~2.0% near target), so growth weakness + inflation benign = Riksbank has MAXIMUM room to cut further

Reaction-function impact (Riksbank): Cuts continue - Feb likely hold (assess), March cut 25bp to 2.00%, April cut to 1.75%, terminal 1.50% by Q3 2026. Riksbank cutting FASTER than ECB despite being in EUR orbit because Sweden-specific weakness (export-dependent, manufacturing weak).

Transmission: SEK WEAKEST NORDICS FX - Riksbank aggressive cutting + growth stalling = SEK/EUR 11.50-11.80 by Q2 (from ~11.40 currently). SEK vs NOK also weak (Norway oil support, Norges Bank less aggressive).

---

THURSDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED

SOUTH AFRICA — Repo Interest Rate Decision (Jan meeting)
• Actual: 6.75% HOLD vs Consensus: 6.75%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: SARB hold 6.75% as expected - South Africa in "patient easing" mode, watching inflation (mid-range 4.5%) and growth (weak Q3 0.3%). SARB has cut 25bp from peak (7.00% → 6.75%), far less aggressive than peers.

Reaction-function impact (SARB): Next cut March/April (25bp to 6.50%), terminal 5.75-6.00% by end-2026. SARB easing will be SLOW and DATA-DEPENDENT (not frontloaded like BoC/Riksbank).

Transmission: ZAR range-bound - carry 6.75% vs Fed 4.50% = 225bp differential supports ZAR, but growth weakness + eventual cuts limit upside. ZAR/USD 17.50-18.50 range through H1 2026.

CROSS-DM SYNTHESIS — WEEK 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEME: DM CENTRAL BANK DIVERGENCE AT MAXIMUM

**THE RBA IS ALONE:**
Australia is the ONLY major DM central bank HIKING in early 2026. This is unprecedented divergence:
- RBA: Hiking from 3.60% → 3.85% (Week 2) → likely 4.10-4.35% terminal
- Fed: HOLDING 4.50% (no cuts until H2 2026 if at all)
- ECB: CUTTING 3.00% → 2.00% (Week 2 EUR data)
- BoE: GRADUAL CUTS 3.75% → terminal 3.00-3.25%
- BoJ: PAUSED 0.75% (next hike Oct 2026)
- BoC: CUTTING 2.25% → terminal 1.50-1.75%
- Riksbank: AGGRESSIVE CUTS 2.25% → terminal 1.50%
- SNB: DOVISH (growth concerns)
- RBNZ: CUTTING (growth weak)

**WHY IS AUSTRALIA DIFFERENT?**
1. **Inflation persistence:** Trimmed mean 3.4% YY (Q4 0.9% QQ annualizes to 3.6%+) vs other DM at/near target
2. **Demand overheating:** CBA assessment "private demand growth much stronger than expected H2 2025" + "credit growth picked up sharply"
3. **Labor tightness:** Unemployment ~4.3% (near full employment) vs Canada 6.5%, Sweden higher, UK higher
4. **Commodity boom:** Iron ore, LNG exports strong (China stimulus + global energy demand)
5. **Financial conditions:** Bullock: "Some indicators suggest financial conditions somewhat accommodative" despite cash rate 3.60% = economy OVERHEATING not cooling

**DM FX HIERARCHY (Week 1 snapshot):**

**STRONGEST (Appreciation):**
→ **AUD (HIGHEST):** RBA solo hawk (hiking 3.85%+), commodity support, China tailwind, growth strong
→ **CHF:** SNB dovish but safe-haven demand, EUR weakness supports CHF
→ **JPY:** BoJ paused but safe-haven bid (risk-off episodes), intervention support at 160 vs USD

**NEUTRAL (Range-bound):**
→ **GBP:** BoE gradual cuts, growth soft landing, rates 3.75% still restrictive
→ **NZD:** RBNZ cutting but less aggressive than Sweden/Canada

**WEAK (Depreciation):**
→ **CAD:** BoC cutting aggressively (terminal 1.50-1.75%), growth stalling (GDP 0.0%), rate differential vs Fed widening
→ **SEK:** Riksbank aggressive cuts (terminal 1.50%), growth miss (Q4 0.2% vs 0.6%)
→ **NOK:** Norges cutting, oil support mitigates but still dovish

**DM RATES DIVERGENCE:**

**HIKING:**
- Australia 3yr swap: 3.20% → 4.00%+ (pricing 2-3 more hikes)

**HOLDING:**
- US 2yr: 4.20-4.40% (Fed terminal debate)
- Japan 2yr: 0.60-0.80% (BoJ Oct hike priced, gradual)

**CUTTING:**
- Canada 2yr: 2.60% → 1.80-2.00% (pricing 3-4 more cuts)
- Sweden 2yr: 2.00% → 1.40-1.60% (aggressive easing)
- UK 2yr: 4.00% → 3.20-3.50% (gradual BoE cuts)
- EUR 2yr (Sch Bloomberg): 2.20% → 1.80-2.00% (ECB cutting)

**CROSS-DM TRADES IMPLIED:**

**HIGHEST CONVICTION:**
1. **Long AUD / Short CAD:** "Solo hawk vs aggressive dove" — RBA hiking to 4.10%+ vs BoC cutting to 1.50-1.75%, commodity divergence (Aus iron ore strong vs Canada oil weaker), growth divergence (Aus strong vs Canada stalling)
2. **Long AUD / Short JPY:** "Hike vs pause" — maximum DM rate differential widening, cleanest carry trade, AUD/JPY 99 → 105-108
3. **Long AUD / Short SEK:** "Strong vs weak" — RBA hiking vs Riksbank aggressive cuts, growth divergence (Aus overheating vs Sweden stalling)

**MEDIUM CONVICTION:**
4. **Long GBP / Short CAD:** "Gradual vs aggressive easing" — BoE measured cuts vs BoC frontloading, UK soft landing vs Canada stall
5. **Long CHF / Short SEK:** "Safe-haven vs peripheral" — SNB dovish but CHF supported, Riksbank aggressive cuts

**AVOID:**
- Short AUD (fundamentals too strong, RBA hiking)
- Long CAD (BoC cutting + growth stalling = double negative)
- Long SEK (Riksbank aggressive + growth weak)

**REGIME SHIFT SUMMARY:**

**PRIOR REGIME (Pre-Week 1):**
"DM central banks mostly dovish/neutral; Australia/NZ restrictive bias; BoJ gradual normalization; BoE/BoC/Riksbank/SNB cutting"

**UPDATED REGIME (Post-Week 1):**
**"DM DIVERGENCE AT MAXIMUM — RBA SOLO HAWK (trimmed mean 0.9% QQ → hike Feb 4 certain, more coming); BoJ PAUSE EXTENDS (Tokyo CPI 2.0% at target → next hike Oct 2026); BoC/Riksbank AGGRESSIVE DOVES (growth stalling, terminal rates sub-2.0%); BoE GRADUAL (soft landing path); AUD STRONGEST DM FX (only hiker + commodity boom + China tailwind); CAD/SEK WEAKEST (aggressive cutting + growth weak)."**

**REGIME TRIGGERS:**

**BULLISH (DM FX convergence, AUD weakens):**
→ **Australia CPI COLLAPSE:** Q1 trimmed mean <0.5% QQ (vs 0.9% Q4) = RBA forced to pause/reverse, AUD crashes
→ **China HARD LANDING:** PMI <47 for 3 months, commodity crash (iron ore $80 → $60) = AUD loses commodity support
→ **Fed DOVISH PIVOT:** 50bp March cut + "growth concerns" = USD weakens broadly, rate differentials compress

**BEARISH (DM FX divergence widens, AUD strengthens further):**
→ **Australia LABOR TIGHTENS:** Unemployment <4.0% + wages >4.5% = RBA forced into 50bp hikes or faster pace (terminal 4.50%+)
→ **Canada RECESSION:** GDP negative Q1 + unemployment >7.0% = BoC cuts 50bp (panic mode), CAD collapses
→ **BoJ DELAYS FURTHER:** Explicitly signals "no hike until 2027" = JPY to 165+, AUD/JPY to 110+

**NEUTRAL (Status quo):**
→ **Gradual divergence persists:** RBA hikes 2-3 times to 4.10-4.35% (as expected), BoJ hikes Oct 2026 (as expected), BoC cuts to 1.75% (as expected) = Current FX hierarchy stable through H1 2026

DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 19–23, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 19 — RELEASED

Japan — Machinery Orders (Nov)
m/m: -11.0% vs -5.1% consensus vs +7.0% prior
y/y: -6.4% vs +4.9% consensus vs +12.5% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside reset in capex intentions — the corporate investment cycle remains fragile despite better services momentum elsewhere.
Secondary: the y/y swing partly reflects base effects after a strong prior, but the m/m collapse is too large to ignore.
Noise: machinery orders are volatile, but this is a regime-consistent weakness rather than a blip.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ caution — hard to tighten financial conditions meaningfully with capex momentum this weak.
Transmission: caps JPY upside via growth expectations; offsets any inflation-led hawkish tail.

United Kingdom — Rightmove House Prices (Jan)
m/m: +2.8% ; y/y: +0.5%
Dominant signal: seasonal rebound is stronger than usual, pointing to tentative housing stabilisation as rate expectations ease.
Secondary: still low y/y — this is not a re-acceleration cycle, just less downside.
Reaction function: mildly hawkish at the margin for BoE (housing no longer screaming distress), but subordinate to inflation/services.
Transmission: marginal GBP support via domestic demand optics.

Japan — Tertiary Industry Activity (Nov)
Actual -2.4% vs -0.7% prior
Dominant signal: services activity corrected sharply after prior strength.
Secondary: reinforces volatility in Japan’s services data; inconsistent with PMI optimism.
Reaction function: keeps BoJ squarely patient — services inflation may matter, but real activity is uneven.
Transmission: JPY-negative at the margin through growth.

Canada — CPI (Dec)
Headline m/m: -0.2% vs -0.3% consensus
Headline y/y: 2.4% vs 2.2% consensus
BoC core y/y: 2.8% (down from 2.9%)
Median: 2.5% vs 2.7% consensus
Trim: 2.7% in line
Dominant signal: core disinflation is grinding on despite a firmer headline y/y print.
Secondary: breadth matters — median cooling offsets sticky trim.
Reaction function: keeps BoC leaning dovish/patient; no reason to reprice hawkish tails.
Transmission: CAD capped; front-end rates biased lower.

New Zealand — Business PSI (Dec)
Actual 51.9 vs 50.7 prior
Dominant signal: services activity back into expansion.
Reaction function/transmission: mildly supportive for NZD, but CPI dominates this week.

ILO unemployment: 5.1% in line
Employment change: +82k vs +30k consensus
Payrolls change: -43k
Avg earnings (3m y/y): 4.7% vs 4.6% consensus
Dominant signal: mixed but still-too-firm wage dynamics despite soft payrolls.
Secondary: employment level strength contrasts with hiring indicators — adjustment via hours/pay rather than headcount.
Reaction function: keeps BoE cautious — wages still inconsistent with rapid easing.
Transmission: front-end gilt downside limited; GBP supported on relative rates.

United Kingdom — Claimant Count (Dec)
Actual +17.9k vs +20.1k prior
Dominant signal: labour market deterioration is gradual, not disorderly.
Reaction function: reinforces gradualism.

New Zealand — Milk Auctions (20 Jan, w/e)
Actual 3,615 vs 3,533 prior
Dominant signal: improving terms-of-trade impulse.
Reaction function: offsets some CPI softness; NZD support via income channel.

WEDNESDAY 21 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — CPI (Dec)
Headline y/y: 3.4% vs 3.3% consensus
Core y/y: 3.2% vs 3.3% consensus
Services y/y: 4.5% in line
Dominant signal: headline ticked up, but core/services did not re-accelerate.
Secondary: inflation persistence remains services-led, not goods-led.
Reaction function: BoE can still cut, but this does not greenlight urgency.
Transmission: gilt rally capped; GBP stable.

United Kingdom — PPI (Dec)
Input m/m: -0.2% ; output m/m: 0.0%
Dominant signal: pipeline disinflation intact.
Reaction function: supports the medium-term easing case.

United Kingdom — CBI Orders / Business Optimism (Jan/Q1)

Dominant signal: forward momentum stabilising.
Reaction function: consistent with RBA “on hold with optionality.”

Canada — Producer Prices (Dec)
Actual -0.6% vs +0.3% consensus
Dominant signal: disinflation in upstream prices.
Reaction function: reinforces BoC dovish bias.

New Zealand — Electronic Card Retail Sales (Dec)
m/m: -0.1% ; y/y: -0.5%
Dominant signal: consumption cooling ahead of CPI.
Reaction function: dovish-leaning growth signal.

Exports y/y: +5.1% vs +6.1% consensus
Imports y/y: +5.3% vs +3.6% consensus
Trade balance: ¥105.7bn vs ¥356.6bn consensus
Dominant signal: net trade disappointed sharply — external support weaker than expected.
Secondary: strong imports reflect domestic demand resilience but worsen growth arithmetic.
Reaction function: neutral-to-dovish for BoJ; external channel not strengthening.
Transmission: JPY-negative via trade balance optics.

Australia — Labour Market (Dec)
Employment: +65.2k vs +30k consensus
Unemployment rate: 4.1% vs 4.4% consensus
Participation: 66.7%
Dominant signal: labour market re-tightening — demand for labour remains strong.
Secondary: participation slightly lower amplifies the unemployment drop.
Reaction function: materially complicates the RBA easing narrative; keeps hike tail alive despite softer CPI.
Transmission: AUD supported via front-end repricing.

Norway — Labour Force Survey (Dec)
Unemployment: 4.3% vs 4.5% prior
Dominant signal: labour market remains tight.
Reaction function: supports Norges Bank hold bias.
Transmission: NOK supportive.

Norway — Policy Rate Decision
Actual 4.00% unchanged
Dominant signal: no surprise; policy remains restrictive.
Reaction function: consistent with “hold for longer.”
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — CBI Distributive Trades (Jan)
Actual -17 vs -44 prior

Dominant signal: sentiment stable at decent levels.
Reaction function: neutral.

New Zealand — CPI (Q4)

Australia — PMI Flash (Jan)
Manufacturing: 52.4 ; Services: 56.0 ; Composite: 55.5
Dominant signal: broad-based acceleration in activity at the start of the year.
Reaction function: reinforces RBA caution; growth is not cracking.
Transmission: AUD-positive via growth/rates expectations.

FRIDAY 23 — RELEASED

Japan — CPI (Dec)
Core y/y: 2.4% in line
Headline y/y: 2.1% vs 2.9% prior
Dominant signal: inflation easing but still above target.
Secondary: disinflation gives BoJ cover to stay patient despite services strength.
Reaction function: status quo reinforced.
Transmission: JPY muted.

Japan — BoJ Rate Decision
Policy rate: 0.75% unchanged
Dominant signal: no shift; BoJ remains cautious and data-dependent.
Reaction function: tightening path remains extremely gradual.
Transmission: limited.

Japan — PMI Flash (Jan)
Manufacturing: 51.5 ; Services: 53.4 ; Composite: 52.8
Dominant signal: services-led growth remains strong; manufacturing back in expansion.
Secondary: contrasts with weak machinery orders — survey vs hard data divergence.
Reaction function: supports patience, not acceleration.
Transmission: JPY modestly supported via growth optics.

United Kingdom — GfK Consumer Confidence (Jan)
Actual -16 vs -16 consensus
Dominant signal: sentiment stabilised but weak.
Reaction function: neutral.

United Kingdom — Retail Sales (Dec)
m/m: +0.4% vs -0.1% consensus
y/y: +2.5% vs +1.1% consensus
Dominant signal: consumption rebounded strongly into year-end.
Secondary: likely helped by discounting; real volume strength uncertain.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish labour signals; supports gradual easing only.
Transmission: GBP supportive; gilt rally capped.

United Kingdom — PMI Flash (Jan)
Composite: 53.9 vs 51.5 consensus
Manufacturing: 51.6 vs 50.6
Services: 54.3 vs 51.7
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise — momentum into 2026 stronger than priced.
Secondary: export orders inflecting matters more than the headline level (if sustained, it’s a regime shift vs “UK stagnation”).
Reaction function: materially reduces near-term cut urgency; hawkish tail fatter (cuts shift from “soon” to “conditional”).
Transmission: GBP-positive; front-end rates reprice higher.

Sweden — Unemployment Rate (Dec)
Actual 8.3% vs 8.2% prior
Dominant signal: labour market softening slowly.
Reaction function: supports Riksbank easing bias; second-order this week.

Canada — Retail Sales (Nov)
Headline m/m: +1.3% vs +1.2% consensus
Ex-autos: +1.7% vs +1.2% consensus
Dominant signal: consumption resilience despite cooling labour market.
Reaction function: tempers BoC dovishness but does not reverse it.
Transmission: CAD mildly supported.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS (what’s new / what mattered)

UK: “soft-landing” probability rose sharply — and the BoE cutting narrative got less urgent.
The week started with mixed labour/wages (not weak enough to force cuts), then CPI delivered “no re-acceleration in core/services,” but the key narrative shock was Friday’s UK flash PMIs + retail sales: that combo is exactly what makes the BoE’s reaction function asymmetric (they can ease only if growth cooperates and inflation keeps falling). This week delivered growth cooperation. Net: cuts become later / more conditional rather than “imminent”; GBP support becomes more durable because it’s backed by activity momentum, not just positioning.

Japan: BoJ stayed on rails — the economy still sends mixed signals, so the tightening path stays ultra-gradual.
Hard data (machinery orders, trade balance) argued for caution; surveys (PMIs) argued for resilience. CPI core in line and the policy decision unchanged crystallise the baseline: BoJ is not accelerating the hiking cycle; it’s waiting for sustained, high-confidence confirmation. Net: JPY remains more a function of global rates and risk than of domestic policy surprise.

Australia/New Zealand: the “rates stay restrictive” tail got fatter (for different reasons).
Australia printed a growth/labour/PMI cluster that keeps the RBA constrained (even if inflation is improving elsewhere). New Zealand CPI came in firmer, pushing easing optionality out. Net: AUD/NZD sensitivity tilts back toward front-end repricing rather than pure risk beta.

Canada: cross-currents (disinflation + resilient consumption) keep the BoC in patient mode, not forced either way.
BoC core measures were consistent with disinflation continuing, but retail sales were strong enough to prevent a “growth break” narrative. Net: BoC can ease, but the urgency is not accelerating — market should price a gradual path, not a rush.

What did not matter this week: low-frequency confidence/sentiment (GfK), stable policy holds (Norges/BoJ were expected), and single-point activity prints without confirmation (one-offs only mattered when clustered, like UK Friday).

<<LIVE_DM_MACRO_BEGIN>>
DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 12–16, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

Sweden — SEB Housing Price Indicator (Jan)
Actual 44.0 vs prior 37.0
Dominant signal: housing sentiment is re-accelerating at the margin — the rate-expectations channel is starting to work again into 2026.
Secondary: this reads as stabilisation plus mild reflation of housing risk appetite rather than a boom.
Noise: diffusion surveys swing with mortgage-rate headlines.
Reaction function: still second-order versus CPIF-XE, but it reduces comfort with an aggressive easing path if it feeds broader financial-conditions easing.
Transmission: SEK reacts only if markets translate this into “fewer / slower cuts”; otherwise this stays a domestic FCI barometer.

Sweden — SEB Housing Price “Increase” share (Jan)
Actual 52.0 vs prior 49.0
Dominant signal: breadth of optimism is widening — a marginal easing of financial conditions.
Secondary/noise: consistent with recovery, not overheating.
Reaction function: trims dovish urgency at the margin; subordinate to inflation prints.

Sweden — SEB Housing Price “Decrease” share (Jan)
Actual 8.0 vs prior 12.0
Dominant signal: downside tail in housing expectations is shrinking.
Secondary: lowers probability of a housing-led downside growth shock.
Reaction function: mildly hawkish at the margin; still subordinate to CPIF.

United Kingdom — KPMG/REC Report on Jobs (Dec survey)
Permanent placements index: 44.3 (prior 45.5)
Candidate availability: 66.7 (prior 66.6)
Permanent salaries: 53.1 (prior 52.7)
Dominant signal: hiring remains in contraction while labour supply is abundant — slack is building.
Secondary: pay growth is positive but well below pre-pandemic norms, consistent with easing wage pressure rather than collapse.
Reaction function: supports conditional easing, but does not override services-inflation persistence.
Transmission: front-end gilt bias lower; GBP impact second-order.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — BRC Retail Sales Monitor (Dec)
Like-for-like sales: +1.0% y/y vs +1.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumption momentum slowed into year-end; nominal growth is fading.
Secondary: absent deflators, this points to weak real volumes.
Reaction function: incremental dovish colour for the BoE; demand is not re-accelerating.
Transmission: mild bull-steepening impulse; limited FX impact.

Japan — Current Account (Nov)
NSA: ¥3.59tn vs ¥3.67tn prior
SA balance: ¥2.48tn
Dominant signal: external surplus remains large, but momentum softened.
Secondary: trade balance still positive; no stress signal.
Reaction function: neutral for BoJ — not a constraint relative to inflation/services dynamics.
Transmission: JPY impact limited unless paired with rate repricing.

Canada — Building Permits (Nov, m/m)
Actual -13.1% vs -5.5% consensus
Dominant signal: sharp downside in construction intentions.
Secondary: reinforces housing sensitivity to tight financial conditions.
Reaction function: dovish-leaning growth signal for BoC, but second-order vs labour/inflation.
Transmission: CAD negative at the margin via growth channel.

WEDNESDAY 14 — RELEASED

Japan — Reuters Tankan Non-Manufacturing Index (Jan)
Actual 33 vs 32 prior

Actual +0.26%
Dominant signal: forward momentum modest but positive.

United Kingdom — MPC communications (Jan 14)
Dominant signal: one member framed trade diversion as structurally disinflationary, favouring a continued downward rate path conditional on data.
Secondary: conditional dovish guidance, not a commitment.
Reaction function: trims hawkish tail; does not override services/wage constraints.
Transmission: front-end sensitivity; GBP depends on relative-cut timing.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

m/m: +0.3% vs +0.1% consensus
3m/3m: +0.1% vs -0.2% consensus
y/y: +1.4% vs +1.1% consensus

Actual -14 vs -16 consensus
Dominant signal: housing stabilising, not recovering.
Reaction function: marginally hawkish vs housing-support rationale.

United Kingdom — BoE Credit Conditions Survey (Q4)
Dominant signal: credit availability still easing, but momentum slowing sharply.
Reaction function: supports gradual easing; financial conditions may not loosen as much as markets expect.

Sweden — CPI / CPIF suite (Dec)
All prints exactly in line with consensus.
Dominant signal: no new information; inflation firmly anchored.
Reaction function: policy becomes FCI- and activity-driven rather than inflation-driven.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

Canada — Housing Starts (Dec)
Actual 282k vs 260k consensus
Dominant signal: housing activity stronger than expected.
Secondary: contrasts with weak permits — volatility rather than trend shift.
Reaction function: neutral; labour/inflation dominate.
Transmission: CAD impact limited.

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 5 — RELEASED

Japan — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 49.7 vs 50.0 consensus vs prior 49.7
Dominant signal: manufacturing remains in contraction and fails to recover into year-end; the miss versus consensus reinforces the view that Japan’s goods cycle is still a drag despite services resilience.
Secondary: the lack of upward revision confirms that late-2025 optimism around external demand was premature.
Noise: small headline miss magnitude; no new collapse signal.
Reaction function: keeps the BoJ constrained by weak real activity despite inflation optics.
Transmission: limits JPY support via growth expectations rather than inflation repricing.

Switzerland — Retail Sales (Nov, y/y)
Actual 2.7% vs 2.3% consensus vs 2.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumer demand remains resilient despite tight financial conditions.
Secondary: upside relative to consensus suggests households are still absorbing higher prices without a sharp pullback.
Noise: single-month volatility.
Reaction function: marginally reduces downside growth risk but not enough to alter SNB disinflation focus.
Transmission: supports CHF via growth resilience rather than policy repricing.

Switzerland — Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.7 vs 45.8 consensus
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise lifts PMI close to expansion threshold; manufacturing contraction is far less severe than feared.
Secondary: suggests external demand weakness may be stabilising rather than accelerating.
Noise: survey volatility after deep pessimism.
Reaction function: lowers urgency for SNB dovish pivot driven by growth fears.
Transmission: supports CHF sentiment through improved cyclical optics.

Actual £2.077bn vs £1.100bn consensus vs £0.977bn prior
Dominant signal: credit growth remains robust, indicating demand resilience despite restrictive policy.
Secondary: suggests financial conditions are not biting households as hard as expected.
Noise: monthly volatility in unsecured credit.
Reaction function: reinforces BoE caution on declaring victory over demand-driven inflation pressures.
Transmission: supports front-end rates via “restrictive but leaky” conditions.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Lending (Nov)
Actual £4.490bn vs £4.500bn consensus vs £4.156bn prior
Dominant signal: mortgage flows stabilising; housing is no longer a sharp drag.

Noise: marginal miss vs consensus.
Reaction function: neutral for BoE; does not argue for early easing.
Transmission: stabilises housing-related growth expectations.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Approvals (Nov)
Actual 64.53k vs 64.40k consensus vs 65.01k prior
Dominant signal: housing demand holding steady.
Secondary: supports the view that rate sensitivity has plateaued.
Noise: small monthly fluctuations.
Reaction function: housing is not forcing BoE’s hand.
Transmission: limits downside risk premia in UK rates and GBP.

Australia — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.0 vs 51.1 consensus
Dominant signal: services expansion intact but not accelerating.

Actual -8.66% vs prior -9.81%
Dominant signal: pace of balance-sheet contraction is slowing.
Secondary: confirms gradual policy normalisation without active tightening.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: BoJ remains cautious; no urgency to tighten liquidity further.
Transmission: mildly supportive for JPY via reduced easing impulse, but secondary to growth.

United Kingdom — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.4 vs 52.1 consensus vs 52.0 prior
Dominant signal: services momentum cooled more than expected.
Secondary: signals some sensitivity to restrictive policy.
Noise: survey revision risk.
Reaction function: introduces mild downside growth optionality but does not override inflation concerns.
Transmission: softens GBP growth support; modest front-end relief.

Transmission: caps upside in UK rates.

United Kingdom — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual $222,488.53m vs $224,754.48m consensus
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock than expected (flow/valuation mix can matter, but this is not a clean “intervention” tell without composition).
Secondary: in the current UK macro setup, this is second-order unless it coincides with stress episodes.
Noise: valuation effects dominate month-to-month.
Reaction function: none for BoE; this is not a domestic demand/inflation input.
Transmission: only relevant if markets start pricing external funding/BoP stress — not implied by this print alone.

Norway — Housing Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual 6.2% vs 5.0% consensus
Dominant signal: housing inflation re-accelerating sharply.
Secondary: indicates financial conditions remain accommodative domestically.
Noise: seasonal distortions.

Transmission: supports NOK via domestic demand and rate-differential channel.

New Zealand — Milk Auctions (6 Jan, w/e)
Actual 3,533 vs prior 3,533
Dominant signal: flat auction result — no new terms-of-trade impulse.
Secondary: stabilisation after prior volatility keeps NZ growth/income narrative unchanged.
Noise: auction-to-auction noise.
Reaction function: neutral for RBNZ at the margin.
Transmission: NZD impact muted.

WEDNESDAY 7 — RELEASED

Japan — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.5 vs 51.6 consensus
Dominant signal: services strength is materially better than expected.
Secondary: confirms two-speed economy — services offsetting manufacturing weakness.
Noise: survey optimism.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ’s patience; inflation-services linkage remains key.
Transmission: supports JPY via domestic demand resilience rather than policy shift.

Japan — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.5 vs 51.1 consensus

Noise: survey breadth.

Australia — CPI (Nov)
Headline m/m: 0.00% vs 0.30% consensus vs 0.00% prior
Headline y/y: 3.40% vs 3.70% consensus vs 3.80% prior
Trimmed mean m/m (SA): 0.30% vs 0.25% consensus vs 0.30% prior

Dominant signal: no clean February signal — headline disinflation is clear, but underlying is still in a “grey zone” (trimmed mean momentum not collapsing).
Secondary: trimmed mean deceleration (key ref: ~0.258% m/m on the trimmed mean) still leaves upside risk to the quarterly CPI forecast (~0.8% q/q); housing details are mixed (rents firmer, new dwellings softer), while discretionary services (restaurants/takeaways) look contained.
Noise: monthly CPI is composition-heavy and can mislead; the quarterly aggregate is the decision-grade input.
Reaction function: keeps both hike/hold on the table; the bar for a hike is not met by this print alone, but the bar for a “done” declaration isn’t met either.
Transmission: caps AUD directionality via front-end range-trading — policy debate stays live until the full-quarter CPI arrives.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, m/m)
Actual +15.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs -6.4% prior
Dominant signal: sharp rebound in construction approvals.
Secondary: housing activity may stabilise sooner than expected.
Noise: catch-up volatility.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish CPI impulse but clearly secondary.
Transmission: marginal support to growth expectations, but inflation dominates.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, y/y)
Actual +5.6% vs +4.4% consensus vs +6.4% prior
Dominant signal: approvals improving vs consensus but growth is not accelerating vs prior.
Secondary: points to stabilisation rather than re-boom.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: neutral for RBA at the margin.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Construction PMI (Dec)
Actual 40.1 vs 42.5 consensus vs 39.4 prior
Dominant signal: construction remains deeply contractionary.
Secondary: weak construction is consistent with late-cycle stagnation, but it’s not the BoE constraint.
Noise: sector-specific.
Reaction function: does not force easing; services/wages still dominate the BoE decision map.
Transmission: growth drag without immediate policy impact.

United Kingdom — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 50.1 vs 50.4 consensus
Dominant signal: economy barely expanding.
Secondary: reinforces late-cycle stagnation narrative.
Noise: small miss.
Reaction function: supports “higher for longer but closer to inflection”.
Transmission: keeps GBP range-bound.

Canada — Ivey PMI (Dec)
Actual 44.5 vs 43.3 consensus
Dominant signal: activity remains contractionary but slightly less weak than feared.

Noise: survey volatility.
Reaction function: neutral for BoC; no inflation signal.
Transmission: limited CAD impact.

Canada — Ivey PMI SA (Dec)
Actual 48.4 vs 51.9 consensus
Dominant signal: underlying momentum weaker than expected.
Secondary: confirms growth slowdown.
Noise: adjustment issues.
Reaction function: marginally dovish bias preserved.
Transmission: negative CAD via growth expectations.

Canada — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.13 vs 9.12 prior
Dominant signal: essentially unchanged risk score.
Secondary/noise: low-frequency index; not a decision-grade macro input this week.
Reaction function: none.
Transmission: negligible.

THURSDAY 8 — RELEASED

Australia — Balance on Goods (Nov)
Actual A$2,936m vs A$4,900m consensus vs A$4,385m prior
Dominant signal: external surplus underwhelms materially; net trade impulse is weaker than expected into Q4 tracking.
Secondary: consistent with a softer export pulse and/or resilience in import demand; confirms AUD’s sensitivity to terms-of-trade and China-linked volume risk.
Noise: one month can swing with commodity pricing/shipments.
Reaction function: not an RBA trigger by itself, but it removes one “growth cushion” that would have made hawkishness easier to justify after the CPI grey zone.
Transmission: mildly AUD-negative through current-account/terms-of-trade optics; reduces upside convexity.

Australia — Exports (Nov)
Actual -2.9% vs +3.4% consensus vs +4.3% prior
Dominant signal: export momentum rolled over hard vs expectations.
Secondary: makes the weak trade balance more “real” (not just imports noise).
Reaction function: dovish-tilt at the margin via growth impulse, but secondary to quarterly CPI.
Transmission: AUD-negative via growth/earnings channel.

Australia — Imports (Nov)
Actual +0.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs +2.4% prior
Dominant signal: import demand cooler than expected — domestic demand not overheating.
Secondary: partially offsets the export weakness in net trade arithmetic, but not enough given the trade balance miss.
Noise: shipment timing.
Reaction function: marginally supports the “hold still plausible” interpretation post-CPI.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, m/m)
Actual -0.6% vs +0.2% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: housing prices softer than expected.
Secondary: confirms the housing channel is still rate-sensitive.
Noise: Halifax is noisy month-to-month.
Reaction function: marginally dovish at the margin but not decisive vs services inflation constraint.
Transmission: slightly easier UK front-end bias; GBP impact second-order.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual +0.3% vs +1.1% consensus vs +0.7% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside surprise underscores housing disinflation.
Secondary: weak price momentum can feed through to consumption confidence later, but lagged.
Noise: sample effects.
Reaction function: adds to the “growth is soft” pile, still not the binding constraint.
Transmission: same as above.

Sweden — CPI Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.3% vs 0.5% consensus vs 0.3% prior
Dominant signal: headline inflation remains very low.
Secondary: keeps the disinflation narrative intact.
Noise: headline is not the Riksbank constraint when CPIF is stable.
Reaction function: supports the easing bias if activity weakens further, but CPIF is the policy metric.
Transmission: SEK support limited; rates bias marginally dovish.

Sweden — CPIF Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.1% vs 2.5% consensus vs 2.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful downside surprise in the policy-relevant measure.
Secondary: suggests underlying inflation is converging faster than expected.
Noise: one flash print, but the direction matters.
Reaction function: strengthens the case that policy can lean dovish without risking a re-acceleration narrative.
Transmission: front-end rates down bias; SEK capped unless global risk helps.

Sweden — CPIF ex Energy Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.3% vs 2.6% consensus vs 2.4% prior
Dominant signal: downside in core-like measure confirms the CPIF surprise is not just energy noise.
Secondary: reduces hawkish tail risk.
Reaction function: dovish optionality rises.
Transmission: reinforces SEK-capping, rates-bullish impulse.

Norway — Manufacturing Output (Nov, m/m)
Actual +2.4% vs -0.9% consensus vs -1.3% prior
Dominant signal: sharp positive surprise — manufacturing is not rolling over despite tight policy.
Secondary: reduces near-term growth downside that would otherwise justify Norges easing.
Noise: volatile series.
Reaction function: supports “hold restrictive” bias, especially when paired with strong housing.
Transmission: NOK supportive via growth/rate differential expectations.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.0% vs -0.1% consensus vs -0.2% prior
Dominant signal: mild upside vs expectations; deflation risk not intensifying.
Secondary: confirms inflation remains extremely low but stable.
Noise: small monthly prints.
Reaction function: keeps SNB comfortable; no urgency either direction.
Transmission: CHF impact small.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: inflation barely positive; low-inflation regime persists.
Reaction function: SNB remains biased toward preventing CHF-driven undershoot, but no immediate catalyst from this print.
Transmission: CHF stays driven by global risk/rates more than domestic CPI.

Canada — Trade Balance (Oct, C$)
Actual -C$0.58bn vs -C$1.36bn consensus vs +C$0.15bn prior
Dominant signal: deficit smaller than feared, but still a deterioration vs prior surplus.
Secondary: narrows near-term growth downside a touch vs consensus.
Noise: commodity price/volume mix.
Reaction function: modestly reduces dovish pressure, but labour/inflation dominate BoC.
Transmission: CAD support is limited; the direction vs prior is still soft.

United Kingdom — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.01 vs 9.01 consensus
Dominant signal/noise: unchanged index; not decision-grade for BoE.
Reaction function/transmission: negligible.

FRIDAY 9 — RELEASED

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, y/y)
Actual +2.9% vs -0.9% consensus vs -2.9% prior (revised -2.3%)
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise in consumption — households are not retrenching as feared.
Secondary: could reflect bonus/seasonality effects, but the level of surprise matters for near-term demand tracking.
Noise: high volatility series.
Reaction function: raises the “services resilience” weight in the BoJ map; reduces the argument that weak manufacturing will quickly drag the whole economy.
Transmission: JPY marginally supported through growth expectations, not immediate policy repricing.

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, m/m)
Actual +6.2% vs +2.7% consensus vs -3.5% prior (revised +0.4%)
Dominant signal: acceleration in sequential momentum reinforces the y/y upside.
Secondary: reinforces the two-speed theme (strong domestic demand vs weak goods).
Reaction function/transmission: same as above.

New Zealand — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual 48,654m vs prior 55,852m
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock can reflect valuation/flow; not a clean stress/intervention signal alone.
Secondary: worth watching only if paired with funding stress or sharp NZD moves (not implied here).
Reaction function: none for RBNZ.
Transmission: limited.

Sweden — GDP (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.9% vs -0.3% consensus vs -0.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful upside growth surprise — activity is not as weak as priced.
Secondary: offsets some of the dovish impulse from the CPIF downside surprise; puts the onus back on inflation rather than growth.
Noise: single month volatility.
Reaction function: increases the probability Riksbank can ease more cautiously (inflation allows it, growth doesn’t force it).
Transmission: SEK ambiguity — inflation says dovish, activity says less urgency.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, y/y)
Actual +3.5% vs +3.6% consensus vs +3.8% prior
Dominant signal: still solid y/y but easing.
Secondary: consistent with “OK level, slowing momentum.”
Reaction function: neutral; GDP surprise carries more weight.
Transmission: minor.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.5% vs prior -1.4%
Dominant signal: rebound adds to the upside activity story.
Reaction function: marginally reduces urgency to ease aggressively.
Transmission: supports the “SEK not one-way weak” case, but still dominated by CPIF.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, y/y)
Actual +4.2% vs +5.9% consensus
Dominant signal: softer than expected on the y/y measure despite the GDP rebound — composition matters.
Secondary: suggests the GDP strength may be broader than industry-value alone (services/other components).
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: keeps the Riksbank able to focus on inflation.
Transmission: mixed.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, m/m)
Actual -0.1% vs prior -6.6% (revised -6.8%)
Dominant signal: stabilisation after a very weak prior month.
Secondary: supports the “activity is not collapsing” read.
Reaction function/transmission: secondary.

Norway — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus
Norway — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 3.2% vs 3.0% consensus vs 2.9% prior
Dominant signal: upside surprise on y/y re-anchors inflation persistence.
Secondary: strengthens the case that domestic inflation is sticky even as Europe disinflates.
Noise: monthly base effects, but direction matters for policy debate.
Reaction function: Norges easing optionality is pushed out; the bar for dovish signalling rises materially when inflation surprises up alongside strong housing and output.
Transmission: NOK-supportive via front-end repricing / higher-for-longer bias.

Norway — Core Inflation (Dec, m/m)
