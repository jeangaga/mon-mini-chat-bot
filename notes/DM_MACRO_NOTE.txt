DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 19–23, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 19 — RELEASED

Japan — Machinery Orders (Nov)
m/m: -11.0% vs -5.1% consensus vs +7.0% prior
y/y: -6.4% vs +4.9% consensus vs +12.5% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside reset in capex intentions — the corporate investment cycle remains fragile despite better services momentum elsewhere.
Secondary: the y/y swing partly reflects base effects after a strong prior, but the m/m collapse is too large to ignore.
Noise: machinery orders are volatile, but this is a regime-consistent weakness rather than a blip.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ caution — hard to tighten financial conditions meaningfully with capex momentum this weak.
Transmission: caps JPY upside via growth expectations; offsets any inflation-led hawkish tail.

United Kingdom — Rightmove House Prices (Jan)
m/m: +2.8% ; y/y: +0.5%
Dominant signal: seasonal rebound is stronger than usual, pointing to tentative housing stabilisation as rate expectations ease.
Secondary: still low y/y — this is not a re-acceleration cycle, just less downside.
Reaction function: mildly hawkish at the margin for BoE (housing no longer screaming distress), but subordinate to inflation/services.
Transmission: marginal GBP support via domestic demand optics.

Japan — Tertiary Industry Activity (Nov)
Actual -2.4% vs -0.7% prior
Dominant signal: services activity corrected sharply after prior strength.
Secondary: reinforces volatility in Japan’s services data; inconsistent with PMI optimism.
Reaction function: keeps BoJ squarely patient — services inflation may matter, but real activity is uneven.
Transmission: JPY-negative at the margin through growth.

Canada — CPI (Dec)
Headline m/m: -0.2% vs -0.3% consensus
Headline y/y: 2.4% vs 2.2% consensus
BoC core y/y: 2.8% (down from 2.9%)
Median: 2.5% vs 2.7% consensus
Trim: 2.7% in line
Dominant signal: core disinflation is grinding on despite a firmer headline y/y print.
Secondary: breadth matters — median cooling offsets sticky trim.
Reaction function: keeps BoC leaning dovish/patient; no reason to reprice hawkish tails.
Transmission: CAD capped; front-end rates biased lower.

New Zealand — Business PSI (Dec)
Actual 51.9 vs 50.7 prior
Dominant signal: services activity back into expansion.
Reaction function/transmission: mildly supportive for NZD, but CPI dominates this week.

Payrolls change: -43k
Avg earnings (3m y/y): 4.7% vs 4.6% consensus
Dominant signal: mixed but still-too-firm wage dynamics despite soft payrolls.
Secondary: employment level strength contrasts with hiring indicators — adjustment via hours/pay rather than headcount.
Reaction function: keeps BoE cautious — wages still inconsistent with rapid easing.
Transmission: front-end gilt downside limited; GBP supported on relative rates.

United Kingdom — Claimant Count (Dec)
Actual +17.9k vs +20.1k prior
Dominant signal: labour market deterioration is gradual, not disorderly.
Reaction function: reinforces gradualism.

New Zealand — Milk Auctions (20 Jan, w/e)
Actual 3,615 vs 3,533 prior
Dominant signal: improving terms-of-trade impulse.

United Kingdom — CPI (Dec)
Headline y/y: 3.4% vs 3.3% consensus
Core y/y: 3.2% vs 3.3% consensus
Services y/y: 4.5% in line
Dominant signal: headline ticked up, but core/services did not re-accelerate.
Secondary: inflation persistence remains services-led, not goods-led.
Reaction function: BoE can still cut, but this does not greenlight urgency.
Transmission: gilt rally capped; GBP stable.

United Kingdom — PPI (Dec)
Input m/m: -0.2% ; output m/m: 0.0%
Dominant signal: pipeline disinflation intact.
Reaction function: supports the medium-term easing case.

Reaction function: consistent with RBA “on hold with optionality.”

Canada — Producer Prices (Dec)
Actual -0.6% vs +0.3% consensus
Dominant signal: disinflation in upstream prices.
Reaction function: reinforces BoC dovish bias.

New Zealand — Electronic Card Retail Sales (Dec)
m/m: -0.1% ; y/y: -0.5%
Dominant signal: consumption cooling ahead of CPI.
Reaction function: dovish-leaning growth signal.

Imports y/y: +5.3% vs +3.6% consensus
Trade balance: ¥105.7bn vs ¥356.6bn consensus
Dominant signal: net trade disappointed sharply — external support weaker than expected.
Secondary: strong imports reflect domestic demand resilience but worsen growth arithmetic.
Reaction function: neutral-to-dovish for BoJ; external channel not strengthening.
Transmission: JPY-negative via trade balance optics.

Australia — Labour Market (Dec)
Employment: +65.2k vs +30k consensus
Unemployment rate: 4.1% vs 4.4% consensus
Participation: 66.7%
Dominant signal: labour market re-tightening — demand for labour remains strong.
Secondary: participation slightly lower amplifies the unemployment drop.
Reaction function: materially complicates the RBA easing narrative; keeps hike tail alive despite softer CPI.
Transmission: AUD supported via front-end repricing.

Norway — Labour Force Survey (Dec)
Unemployment: 4.3% vs 4.5% prior
Dominant signal: labour market remains tight.
Reaction function: supports Norges Bank hold bias.
Transmission: NOK supportive.

Norway — Policy Rate Decision
Actual 4.00% unchanged
Dominant signal: no surprise; policy remains restrictive.
Reaction function: consistent with “hold for longer.”
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — CBI Distributive Trades (Jan)
Actual -17 vs -44 prior

Transmission: AUD-positive via growth/rates expectations.

FRIDAY 23 — RELEASED

Japan — CPI (Dec)
Core y/y: 2.4% in line
Headline y/y: 2.1% vs 2.9% prior
Dominant signal: inflation easing but still above target.
Secondary: disinflation gives BoJ cover to stay patient despite services strength.
Reaction function: status quo reinforced.
Transmission: JPY muted.

Japan — BoJ Rate Decision
Policy rate: 0.75% unchanged
Dominant signal: no shift; BoJ remains cautious and data-dependent.
Reaction function: tightening path remains extremely gradual.
Transmission: limited.

Japan — PMI Flash (Jan)
Manufacturing: 51.5 ; Services: 53.4 ; Composite: 52.8
Dominant signal: services-led growth remains strong; manufacturing back in expansion.
Secondary: contrasts with weak machinery orders — survey vs hard data divergence.
Reaction function: supports patience, not acceleration.
Transmission: JPY modestly supported via growth optics.

United Kingdom — GfK Consumer Confidence (Jan)
Actual -16 vs -16 consensus
Dominant signal: sentiment stabilised but weak.
Reaction function: neutral.

United Kingdom — Retail Sales (Dec)
m/m: +0.4% vs -0.1% consensus
y/y: +2.5% vs +1.1% consensus
Dominant signal: consumption rebounded strongly into year-end.
Secondary: likely helped by discounting; real volume strength uncertain.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish labour signals; supports gradual easing only.
Transmission: GBP supportive; gilt rally capped.

United Kingdom — PMI Flash (Jan)
Composite: 53.9 vs 51.5 consensus
Manufacturing: 51.6 vs 50.6
Services: 54.3 vs 51.7
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise — momentum into 2026 stronger than priced.
Secondary: export orders inflecting matters more than the headline level (if sustained, it’s a regime shift vs “UK stagnation”).
Reaction function: materially reduces near-term cut urgency; hawkish tail fatter (cuts shift from “soon” to “conditional”).
Transmission: GBP-positive; front-end rates reprice higher.

Sweden — Unemployment Rate (Dec)
Actual 8.3% vs 8.2% prior
Dominant signal: labour market softening slowly.
Reaction function: supports Riksbank easing bias; second-order this week.

Canada — Retail Sales (Nov)
Headline m/m: +1.3% vs +1.2% consensus
Ex-autos: +1.7% vs +1.2% consensus
Dominant signal: consumption resilience despite cooling labour market.
Reaction function: tempers BoC dovishness but does not reverse it.
Transmission: CAD mildly supported.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS (what’s new / what mattered)

UK: “soft-landing” probability rose sharply — and the BoE cutting narrative got less urgent.
The week started with mixed labour/wages (not weak enough to force cuts), then CPI delivered “no re-acceleration in core/services,” but the key narrative shock was Friday’s UK flash PMIs + retail sales: that combo is exactly what makes the BoE’s reaction function asymmetric (they can ease only if growth cooperates and inflation keeps falling). This week delivered growth cooperation. Net: cuts become later / more conditional rather than “imminent”; GBP support becomes more durable because it’s backed by activity momentum, not just positioning.

Japan: BoJ stayed on rails — the economy still sends mixed signals, so the tightening path stays ultra-gradual.
Hard data (machinery orders, trade balance) argued for caution; surveys (PMIs) argued for resilience. CPI core in line and the policy decision unchanged crystallise the baseline: BoJ is not accelerating the hiking cycle; it’s waiting for sustained, high-confidence confirmation. Net: JPY remains more a function of global rates and risk than of domestic policy surprise.

Australia/New Zealand: the “rates stay restrictive” tail got fatter (for different reasons).
Australia printed a growth/labour/PMI cluster that keeps the RBA constrained (even if inflation is improving elsewhere). New Zealand CPI came in firmer, pushing easing optionality out. Net: AUD/NZD sensitivity tilts back toward front-end repricing rather than pure risk beta.

Canada: cross-currents (disinflation + resilient consumption) keep the BoC in patient mode, not forced either way.
BoC core measures were consistent with disinflation continuing, but retail sales were strong enough to prevent a “growth break” narrative. Net: BoC can ease, but the urgency is not accelerating — market should price a gradual path, not a rush.

What did not matter this week: low-frequency confidence/sentiment (GfK), stable policy holds (Norges/BoJ were expected), and single-point activity prints without confirmation (one-offs only mattered when clustered, like UK Friday).

DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 12–16, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

Sweden — SEB Housing Price Indicator (Jan)
Actual 44.0 vs prior 37.0
Dominant signal: housing sentiment is re-accelerating at the margin — the rate-expectations channel is starting to work again into 2026.
Secondary: this reads as stabilisation plus mild reflation of housing risk appetite rather than a boom.
Noise: diffusion surveys swing with mortgage-rate headlines.
Reaction function: still second-order versus CPIF-XE, but it reduces comfort with an aggressive easing path if it feeds broader financial-conditions easing.
Transmission: SEK reacts only if markets translate this into “fewer / slower cuts”; otherwise this stays a domestic FCI barometer.

Sweden — SEB Housing Price “Increase” share (Jan)
Actual 52.0 vs prior 49.0
Dominant signal: breadth of optimism is widening — a marginal easing of financial conditions.
Secondary/noise: consistent with recovery, not overheating.
Reaction function: trims dovish urgency at the margin; subordinate to inflation prints.

Sweden — SEB Housing Price “Decrease” share (Jan)
Actual 8.0 vs prior 12.0
Dominant signal: downside tail in housing expectations is shrinking.
Secondary: lowers probability of a housing-led downside growth shock.

Permanent placements index: 44.3 (prior 45.5)
Candidate availability: 66.7 (prior 66.6)
Permanent salaries: 53.1 (prior 52.7)
Dominant signal: hiring remains in contraction while labour supply is abundant — slack is building.
Secondary: pay growth is positive but well below pre-pandemic norms, consistent with easing wage pressure rather than collapse.
Reaction function: supports conditional easing, but does not override services-inflation persistence.
Transmission: front-end gilt bias lower; GBP impact second-order.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — BRC Retail Sales Monitor (Dec)
Like-for-like sales: +1.0% y/y vs +1.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumption momentum slowed into year-end; nominal growth is fading.
Secondary: absent deflators, this points to weak real volumes.
Reaction function: incremental dovish colour for the BoE; demand is not re-accelerating.
Transmission: mild bull-steepening impulse; limited FX impact.

Japan — Current Account (Nov)
NSA: ¥3.59tn vs ¥3.67tn prior
SA balance: ¥2.48tn

Actual -13.1% vs -5.5% consensus
Dominant signal: sharp downside in construction intentions.

WEDNESDAY 14 — RELEASED

Japan — Reuters Tankan Non-Manufacturing Index (Jan)
Actual 33 vs 32 prior

Japan — Broad Money (Dec)
Actual ¥2,238.9tn vs ¥2,241.3tn prior
Dominant signal: liquidity growth remains controlled.
Reaction function: neutral; consistent with gradual normalisation.

Canada — Leading Index (Dec)
Actual +0.26%
Dominant signal: forward momentum modest but positive.
Reaction function: neutral; not decisive vs labour market.

United Kingdom — MPC communications (Jan 14)
Dominant signal: one member framed trade diversion as structurally disinflationary, favouring a continued downward rate path conditional on data.
Secondary: conditional dovish guidance, not a commitment.
Reaction function: trims hawkish tail; does not override services/wage constraints.
Transmission: front-end sensitivity; GBP depends on relative-cut timing.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

United Kingdom — GDP (Nov)
m/m: +0.3% vs +0.1% consensus
3m/3m: +0.1% vs -0.2% consensus
y/y: +1.4% vs +1.1% consensus
Dominant signal: growth firmer than feared; Q4 tracking improved.

Actual -14 vs -16 consensus
Dominant signal: housing stabilising, not recovering.
Reaction function: marginally hawkish vs housing-support rationale.

United Kingdom — BoE Credit Conditions Survey (Q4)
Dominant signal: credit availability still easing, but momentum slowing sharply.
Reaction function: supports gradual easing; financial conditions may not loosen as much as markets expect.

Sweden — CPI / CPIF suite (Dec)
All prints exactly in line with consensus.
Dominant signal: no new information; inflation firmly anchored.
Reaction function: policy becomes FCI- and activity-driven rather than inflation-driven.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

Canada — Housing Starts (Dec)
Actual 282k vs 260k consensus
Dominant signal: housing activity stronger than expected.
Secondary: contrasts with weak permits — volatility rather than trend shift.
Reaction function: neutral; labour/inflation dominate.
Transmission: CAD impact limited.

<<LIVE_DM_MACRO_END>>

<<LIVE_DM_MACRO_BEGIN>>
DM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 5–9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close

MONDAY 5 — RELEASED

Japan — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 49.7 vs 50.0 consensus vs prior 49.7
Dominant signal: manufacturing remains in contraction and fails to recover into year-end; the miss versus consensus reinforces the view that Japan’s goods cycle is still a drag despite services resilience.
Secondary: the lack of upward revision confirms that late-2025 optimism around external demand was premature.
Noise: small headline miss magnitude; no new collapse signal.
Reaction function: keeps the BoJ constrained by weak real activity despite inflation optics.
Transmission: limits JPY support via growth expectations rather than inflation repricing.

Switzerland — Retail Sales (Nov, y/y)
Actual 2.7% vs 2.3% consensus vs 2.2% prior
Dominant signal: consumer demand remains resilient despite tight financial conditions.
Secondary: upside relative to consensus suggests households are still absorbing higher prices without a sharp pullback.
Noise: single-month volatility.
Reaction function: marginally reduces downside growth risk but not enough to alter SNB disinflation focus.
Transmission: supports CHF via growth resilience rather than policy repricing.

Switzerland — Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.7 vs 45.8 consensus
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise lifts PMI close to expansion threshold; manufacturing contraction is far less severe than feared.
Secondary: suggests external demand weakness may be stabilising rather than accelerating.
Noise: survey volatility after deep pessimism.
Reaction function: lowers urgency for SNB dovish pivot driven by growth fears.
Transmission: supports CHF sentiment through improved cyclical optics.

United Kingdom — BoE Consumer Credit (Nov)
Actual £2.077bn vs £1.100bn consensus vs £0.977bn prior
Dominant signal: credit growth remains robust, indicating demand resilience despite restrictive policy.
Secondary: suggests financial conditions are not biting households as hard as expected.
Noise: monthly volatility in unsecured credit.
Reaction function: reinforces BoE caution on declaring victory over demand-driven inflation pressures.
Transmission: supports front-end rates via “restrictive but leaky” conditions.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Lending (Nov)
Actual £4.490bn vs £4.500bn consensus vs £4.156bn prior
Dominant signal: mortgage flows stabilising; housing is no longer a sharp drag.
Secondary: consistent with gradual adjustment rather than collapse.
Noise: marginal miss vs consensus.
Reaction function: neutral for BoE; does not argue for early easing.
Transmission: stabilises housing-related growth expectations.

United Kingdom — Mortgage Approvals (Nov)
Actual 64.53k vs 64.40k consensus vs 65.01k prior
Dominant signal: housing demand holding steady.
Secondary: supports the view that rate sensitivity has plateaued.
Noise: small monthly fluctuations.
Reaction function: housing is not forcing BoE’s hand.
Transmission: limits downside risk premia in UK rates and GBP.

Australia — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.0 vs 51.1 consensus

Transmission: stabilises AUD growth narrative.

TUESDAY 6 — RELEASED

Japan — Monetary Base (Dec, y/y)
Actual -8.66% vs prior -9.81%
Dominant signal: pace of balance-sheet contraction is slowing.
Secondary: confirms gradual policy normalisation without active tightening.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: BoJ remains cautious; no urgency to tighten liquidity further.
Transmission: mildly supportive for JPY via reduced easing impulse, but secondary to growth.

United Kingdom — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.4 vs 52.1 consensus vs 52.0 prior
Dominant signal: services momentum cooled more than expected.
Secondary: signals some sensitivity to restrictive policy.

Transmission: caps upside in UK rates.

United Kingdom — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual $222,488.53m vs $224,754.48m consensus
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock than expected (flow/valuation mix can matter, but this is not a clean “intervention” tell without composition).
Secondary: in the current UK macro setup, this is second-order unless it coincides with stress episodes.
Noise: valuation effects dominate month-to-month.
Reaction function: none for BoE; this is not a domestic demand/inflation input.
Transmission: only relevant if markets start pricing external funding/BoP stress — not implied by this print alone.

Norway — Housing Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual 6.2% vs 5.0% consensus
Dominant signal: housing inflation re-accelerating sharply.
Secondary: indicates financial conditions remain accommodative domestically.

Secondary: stabilisation after prior volatility keeps NZ growth/income narrative unchanged.
Noise: auction-to-auction noise.
Reaction function: neutral for RBNZ at the margin.
Transmission: NZD impact muted.

WEDNESDAY 7 — RELEASED

Japan — Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.5 vs 51.6 consensus
Dominant signal: services strength is materially better than expected.
Secondary: confirms two-speed economy — services offsetting manufacturing weakness.
Noise: survey optimism.
Reaction function: reinforces BoJ’s patience; inflation-services linkage remains key.
Transmission: supports JPY via domestic demand resilience rather than policy shift.

Japan — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 51.5 vs 51.1 consensus
Dominant signal: overall activity stronger than feared.
Secondary: supports “no hard landing” narrative.
Noise: survey breadth.
Reaction function: neutral-to-supportive for gradual normalisation.
Transmission: modestly JPY-supportive.

Australia — CPI (Nov)
Headline m/m: 0.00% vs 0.30% consensus vs 0.00% prior
Headline y/y: 3.40% vs 3.70% consensus vs 3.80% prior
Trimmed mean m/m (SA): 0.30% vs 0.25% consensus vs 0.30% prior

Dominant signal: no clean February signal — headline disinflation is clear, but underlying is still in a “grey zone” (trimmed mean momentum not collapsing).
Secondary: trimmed mean deceleration (key ref: ~0.258% m/m on the trimmed mean) still leaves upside risk to the quarterly CPI forecast (~0.8% q/q); housing details are mixed (rents firmer, new dwellings softer), while discretionary services (restaurants/takeaways) look contained.
Noise: monthly CPI is composition-heavy and can mislead; the quarterly aggregate is the decision-grade input.
Reaction function: keeps both hike/hold on the table; the bar for a hike is not met by this print alone, but the bar for a “done” declaration isn’t met either.
Transmission: caps AUD directionality via front-end range-trading — policy debate stays live until the full-quarter CPI arrives.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, m/m)
Actual +15.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs -6.4% prior
Dominant signal: sharp rebound in construction approvals.
Secondary: housing activity may stabilise sooner than expected.
Noise: catch-up volatility.
Reaction function: offsets some dovish CPI impulse but clearly secondary.
Transmission: marginal support to growth expectations, but inflation dominates.

Australia — Building Approvals (Nov, y/y)
Actual +5.6% vs +4.4% consensus vs +6.4% prior
Dominant signal: approvals improving vs consensus but growth is not accelerating vs prior.
Secondary: points to stabilisation rather than re-boom.
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: neutral for RBA at the margin.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Construction PMI (Dec)
Actual 40.1 vs 42.5 consensus vs 39.4 prior
Dominant signal: construction remains deeply contractionary.
Secondary: weak construction is consistent with late-cycle stagnation, but it’s not the BoE constraint.
Noise: sector-specific.
Reaction function: does not force easing; services/wages still dominate the BoE decision map.
Transmission: growth drag without immediate policy impact.

United Kingdom — Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 50.1 vs 50.4 consensus
Dominant signal: economy barely expanding.
Secondary: reinforces late-cycle stagnation narrative.
Noise: small miss.
Reaction function: supports “higher for longer but closer to inflection”.
Transmission: keeps GBP range-bound.

Canada — Ivey PMI (Dec)
Actual 44.5 vs 43.3 consensus
Dominant signal: activity remains contractionary but slightly less weak than feared.
Secondary: domestic demand still soft.
Noise: survey volatility.
Reaction function: neutral for BoC; no inflation signal.
Transmission: limited CAD impact.

Canada — Ivey PMI SA (Dec)
Actual 48.4 vs 51.9 consensus
Dominant signal: underlying momentum weaker than expected.
Secondary: confirms growth slowdown.
Noise: adjustment issues.
Reaction function: marginally dovish bias preserved.
Transmission: negative CAD via growth expectations.

Canada — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.13 vs 9.12 prior
Dominant signal: essentially unchanged risk score.
Secondary/noise: low-frequency index; not a decision-grade macro input this week.
Reaction function: none.
Transmission: negligible.

THURSDAY 8 — RELEASED

Australia — Balance on Goods (Nov)
Actual A$2,936m vs A$4,900m consensus vs A$4,385m prior
Dominant signal: external surplus underwhelms materially; net trade impulse is weaker than expected into Q4 tracking.
Secondary: consistent with a softer export pulse and/or resilience in import demand; confirms AUD’s sensitivity to terms-of-trade and China-linked volume risk.
Noise: one month can swing with commodity pricing/shipments.
Reaction function: not an RBA trigger by itself, but it removes one “growth cushion” that would have made hawkishness easier to justify after the CPI grey zone.
Transmission: mildly AUD-negative through current-account/terms-of-trade optics; reduces upside convexity.

Australia — Exports (Nov)
Actual -2.9% vs +3.4% consensus vs +4.3% prior
Dominant signal: export momentum rolled over hard vs expectations.
Secondary: makes the weak trade balance more “real” (not just imports noise).
Reaction function: dovish-tilt at the margin via growth impulse, but secondary to quarterly CPI.
Transmission: AUD-negative via growth/earnings channel.

Australia — Imports (Nov)
Actual +0.2% vs +2.0% consensus vs +2.4% prior
Dominant signal: import demand cooler than expected — domestic demand not overheating.
Secondary: partially offsets the export weakness in net trade arithmetic, but not enough given the trade balance miss.
Noise: shipment timing.
Reaction function: marginally supports the “hold still plausible” interpretation post-CPI.
Transmission: limited.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, m/m)
Actual -0.6% vs +0.2% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: housing prices softer than expected.
Secondary: confirms the housing channel is still rate-sensitive.
Noise: Halifax is noisy month-to-month.
Reaction function: marginally dovish at the margin but not decisive vs services inflation constraint.
Transmission: slightly easier UK front-end bias; GBP impact second-order.

United Kingdom — Halifax House Prices (Dec, y/y)
Actual +0.3% vs +1.1% consensus vs +0.7% prior
Dominant signal: sharp downside surprise underscores housing disinflation.
Secondary: weak price momentum can feed through to consumption confidence later, but lagged.
Noise: sample effects.
Reaction function: adds to the “growth is soft” pile, still not the binding constraint.
Transmission: same as above.

Sweden — CPI Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.3% vs 0.5% consensus vs 0.3% prior
Dominant signal: headline inflation remains very low.
Secondary: keeps the disinflation narrative intact.
Noise: headline is not the Riksbank constraint when CPIF is stable.
Reaction function: supports the easing bias if activity weakens further, but CPIF is the policy metric.
Transmission: SEK support limited; rates bias marginally dovish.

Sweden — CPIF Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.1% vs 2.5% consensus vs 2.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful downside surprise in the policy-relevant measure.
Secondary: suggests underlying inflation is converging faster than expected.
Noise: one flash print, but the direction matters.
Reaction function: strengthens the case that policy can lean dovish without risking a re-acceleration narrative.
Transmission: front-end rates down bias; SEK capped unless global risk helps.

Sweden — CPIF ex Energy Flash (Dec, y/y)
Actual 2.3% vs 2.6% consensus vs 2.4% prior
Dominant signal: downside in core-like measure confirms the CPIF surprise is not just energy noise.
Secondary: reduces hawkish tail risk.
Reaction function: dovish optionality rises.
Transmission: reinforces SEK-capping, rates-bullish impulse.

Norway — Manufacturing Output (Nov, m/m)
Actual +2.4% vs -0.9% consensus vs -1.3% prior
Dominant signal: sharp positive surprise — manufacturing is not rolling over despite tight policy.
Secondary: reduces near-term growth downside that would otherwise justify Norges easing.
Noise: volatile series.
Reaction function: supports “hold restrictive” bias, especially when paired with strong housing.
Transmission: NOK supportive via growth/rate differential expectations.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.0% vs -0.1% consensus vs -0.2% prior
Dominant signal: mild upside vs expectations; deflation risk not intensifying.
Secondary: confirms inflation remains extremely low but stable.
Noise: small monthly prints.
Reaction function: keeps SNB comfortable; no urgency either direction.
Transmission: CHF impact small.

Switzerland — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus vs 0.0% prior
Dominant signal: inflation barely positive; low-inflation regime persists.
Reaction function: SNB remains biased toward preventing CHF-driven undershoot, but no immediate catalyst from this print.
Transmission: CHF stays driven by global risk/rates more than domestic CPI.

Canada — Trade Balance (Oct, C$)
Actual -C$0.58bn vs -C$1.36bn consensus vs +C$0.15bn prior
Dominant signal: deficit smaller than feared, but still a deterioration vs prior surplus.
Secondary: narrows near-term growth downside a touch vs consensus.
Noise: commodity price/volume mix.
Reaction function: modestly reduces dovish pressure, but labour/inflation dominate BoC.
Transmission: CAD support is limited; the direction vs prior is still soft.

United Kingdom — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 9.01 vs 9.01 consensus
Dominant signal/noise: unchanged index; not decision-grade for BoE.
Reaction function/transmission: negligible.

FRIDAY 9 — RELEASED

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, y/y)
Actual +2.9% vs -0.9% consensus vs -2.9% prior (revised -2.3%)
Dominant signal: sharp upside surprise in consumption — households are not retrenching as feared.
Secondary: could reflect bonus/seasonality effects, but the level of surprise matters for near-term demand tracking.
Noise: high volatility series.
Reaction function: raises the “services resilience” weight in the BoJ map; reduces the argument that weak manufacturing will quickly drag the whole economy.
Transmission: JPY marginally supported through growth expectations, not immediate policy repricing.

Japan — All Household Spending (Nov, m/m)
Actual +6.2% vs +2.7% consensus vs -3.5% prior (revised +0.4%)
Dominant signal: acceleration in sequential momentum reinforces the y/y upside.
Secondary: reinforces the two-speed theme (strong domestic demand vs weak goods).
Reaction function/transmission: same as above.

New Zealand — Reserve Assets Total (Dec)
Actual 48,654m vs prior 55,852m
Dominant signal: lower reserve stock can reflect valuation/flow; not a clean stress/intervention signal alone.
Secondary: worth watching only if paired with funding stress or sharp NZD moves (not implied here).
Reaction function: none for RBNZ.
Transmission: limited.

Sweden — GDP (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.9% vs -0.3% consensus vs -0.3% prior
Dominant signal: meaningful upside growth surprise — activity is not as weak as priced.
Secondary: offsets some of the dovish impulse from the CPIF downside surprise; puts the onus back on inflation rather than growth.
Noise: single month volatility.
Reaction function: increases the probability Riksbank can ease more cautiously (inflation allows it, growth doesn’t force it).
Transmission: SEK ambiguity — inflation says dovish, activity says less urgency.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, y/y)
Actual +3.5% vs +3.6% consensus vs +3.8% prior
Dominant signal: still solid y/y but easing.
Secondary: consistent with “OK level, slowing momentum.”
Reaction function: neutral; GDP surprise carries more weight.
Transmission: minor.

Sweden — Private Production (Nov, m/m)
Actual +0.5% vs prior -1.4%
Dominant signal: rebound adds to the upside activity story.
Reaction function: marginally reduces urgency to ease aggressively.
Transmission: supports the “SEK not one-way weak” case, but still dominated by CPIF.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, y/y)
Actual +4.2% vs +5.9% consensus
Dominant signal: softer than expected on the y/y measure despite the GDP rebound — composition matters.
Secondary: suggests the GDP strength may be broader than industry-value alone (services/other components).
Noise: base effects.
Reaction function: keeps the Riksbank able to focus on inflation.
Transmission: mixed.

Sweden — Industrial Production Value (Nov, m/m)
Actual -0.1% vs prior -6.6% (revised -6.8%)
Dominant signal: stabilisation after a very weak prior month.
Secondary: supports the “activity is not collapsing” read.
Reaction function/transmission: secondary.

Norway — CPI (Dec, m/m)
Actual 0.1% vs 0.1% consensus
Norway — CPI (Dec, y/y)
Actual 3.2% vs 3.0% consensus vs 2.9% prior
Dominant signal: upside surprise on y/y re-anchors inflation persistence.
Secondary: strengthens the case that domestic inflation is sticky even as Europe disinflates.
Noise: monthly base effects, but direction matters for policy debate.
Reaction function: Norges easing optionality is pushed out; the bar for dovish signalling rises materially when inflation surprises up alongside strong housing and output.
Transmission: NOK-supportive via front-end repricing / higher-for-longer bias.

Norway — Core Inflation (Dec, m/m)
