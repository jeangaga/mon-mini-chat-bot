USD MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 5–Jan 9, 2026)
STATUS: Live as of Wednesday close

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

ISM Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 47.9 vs Cons 48.4 vs Prior 48.2
HF take: First-order signal remains manufacturing contraction with marginal deterioration. This is not the binding constraint for policy unless it transmits into labor or services; transmission is via risk sentiment, cyclicals, and term premium, not the Fed path. Secondary: reinforces the “weak goods / resilient services” regime rather than a broad growth break.

ISM Mfg Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual 58.5 vs Cons 57.0 vs Prior 58.5
HF take: Sticky upstream price pressure despite contraction. This keeps the inflation tail alive and raises the bar for aggressive dovish repricing on growth-only fears. Alone, it’s secondary unless confirmed by CPI/PCE momentum.

ISM Manufacturing Employment (Dec)
Actual 44.0 vs Prior 44.9
HF take: Goods-sector labor demand remains weak; second-order for payrolls unless corroborated by claims/NFP diffusion.

ISM Manufacturing New Orders (Dec)
Actual 47.4 vs Prior 47.7
HF take: Orders remain below 50; no inventory-led rebound signal yet. Market relevance only if it bleeds into broader demand.

U.S. 6M Bill Auction (Jan 5) — High 3.475%, BTC 3.280
HF take: Funding micro; no stress signal.

U.S. 3M Bill Auction (Jan 5) — High 3.540%, BTC 2.840
HF take: Same; background only.

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 53.0 vs Cons 52.7
HF take: Growth resilience persists, offsetting weak ISM manufacturing. Supports “no urgency to cut” absent inflation confirmation; caps bull-steepener enthusiasm.

S&P Global Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.9 vs Cons 52.5
HF take: Services remain expansionary; reduces probability that weak goods data alone force a dovish pivot.

Redbook YoY (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 7.1% vs Prior 7.6%
HF take: Marginal cooling; noise unless confirmed by hard consumption.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

MBA Mortgage Applications (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual +0.3% vs Prior -10.0%
HF take: Small bounce after volatility; second-order unless persistent.

MBA 30Y Mortgage Rate (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual 6.25% vs Prior 6.32%
HF take: Directionally supportive, still restrictive; slow transmission.

ADP National Employment (Dec)
Actual +41k vs Cons ~50k vs Prior revised -29k
HF take: “Ok but not hot.” Positive after a negative prior, but soft vs late-cycle strength. Stand-alone policy impact limited; mainly sets expectations into NFP.

Durable Goods Orders (Oct, revised)
Actual -2.2% m/m vs Cons -2.2%
HF take: Confirms goods/capex softness; indirect policy relevance.

Durables ex-Defense (Oct, revised)
Actual -1.5% m/m
HF take: Confirmation print.

Durables ex-Transport (Oct, revised)
Actual +0.2% m/m vs Prior +0.1%
HF take: Nuance: underlying orders not collapsing; second-order offset.

Nondefense Capex ex-Aircraft (Oct, revised)
Actual +0.5% m/m
HF take: Capex proxy holding up; caps downside growth tail.

Factory Orders (Oct)
Actual -1.3% m/m vs Cons -1.2% vs Prior +0.2%
HF take: Hard-data goods softness; supports cooling narrative without regime change.

Factory Orders ex-Transport (Oct)
Actual +0.2% m/m vs Prior +0.1%
HF take: Underlying trend firmer than headline.

ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 54.4 vs Cons 52.3 vs Prior 52.6
HF take (dominant print so far): Services ended the year strong, rising to a 13-month high with broad-based gains. This materially raises the confidence threshold for easing and truncates the near-term dovish tail unless inflation breaks decisively. Transmission: front-end pressure / curve flattening risk; USD support via relative growth and policy asymmetry.

— Internal mix that professionals care about:
• Employment rebounded to expansion (~52), pushing back against a sharp labor slowdown narrative.
• New orders surged to a ~15-month high (~57+), rebuilding forward momentum into early 2026 (even if partly reversing November weakness).
• Supplier deliveries eased; some sequential strength likely reflects post-shutdown normalization, so month-to-month acceleration is down-weighted in favor of cross-survey confirmation.

ISM Services Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual ~64.3 (eight-month low) vs Prior ~65.4
HF take: Directionally constructive—inflation pressure is no longer accelerating—but levels remain consistent with elevated supercore PCE near term. This supports “hold longer,” not early cuts; services/wages remain the constraint.

ISM Services Business Activity (Dec)
Actual 54.5 vs Prior 56.0
HF take: Still strong; minor dip is secondary versus the headline upside.

ISM Services New Orders (Dec)
Actual ~57.9 vs Prior ~52.9
HF take: Forward-looking strength matters; supports resilience into the new year.

ISM Services Employment (Dec)
Actual ~52.0 vs Prior ~48.9
HF take: Employment back in expansion aligns with resilience; argues against an imminent labor shock.

JOLTS Job Openings (Nov)
Actual 7.146M vs Cons 7.600M vs Prior 7.670M
HF take: Continued cooling in labor demand; secondary versus strong services activity. Caps hawkish wage fears but doesn’t deliver a dovish pivot alone.

EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual -3.832M vs Cons +0.447M vs Prior -1.934M
HF take: Large draw supports crude near term; macro relevance second-order unless sustained into prices.

EIA Distillate Stocks (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual +5.594M vs Cons +2.109M
HF take: Mixed demand/inventory dynamics; macro impulse limited.

EIA Gasoline Stocks (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual +7.702M vs Cons +3.186M
HF take: Softer end-demand / seasonal effects; offsets crude tightness.

EIA Refinery Utilization (w/e 2 Jan)
Actual 0.0% vs Cons +0.1%
HF take: Neutral.

THURSDAY 08 — PREVIEW

Challenger Layoffs (Dec)
Sensitivity: Only market-relevant if cuts re-accelerate beyond year-end noise and confirm labor cooling.

International Trade (Oct)
Sensitivity: Imports vs exports for domestic demand/inventory signal, not the deficit.

Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 3 Jan)
Sensitivity: Cleanest real-time labor barometer; sustained rise would validate cooling and skew rates dovish.

Continuing Claims (w/e 27 Dec)
Sensitivity: Persistence > one-off move.

Productivity / Unit Labor Costs (Q3 prelim)
Sensitivity: Wage-inflation transmission; lower ULC helps disinflation, higher ULC keeps services tail alive.

Wholesale Inventories / Sales (Oct)
Sensitivity: GDP tracking; second-order unless sharp demand downshift.

EIA Natural Gas Change (w/e 2 Jan)
Commodity-micro unless price sensitivity broadens.

4W Bill Auction (Jan 8)
Funding micro.

Consumer Credit (Nov)
Sensitivity: Revolving vs non-revolving split—financed consumption risk check.

FRIDAY 09 — PREVIEW

Non-Farm Payrolls (Dec), Unemployment Rate, Average Earnings
Anchor: Decides whether services strength (hawkish) or labor cooling (dovish) dominates the week.

Housing Starts / Building Permits (Oct)
Sensitivity: Permits lead; starts confirm housing cadence and shelter-inflation lag.

U. Michigan Sentiment (Jan prelim) + Inflation Expectations
Sensitivity: Expectations only matter if they move sharply.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS
Not triggered yet (claims + NFP are decisive).

Date: 2 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Window: last 4 weeks into year-end 2025 (with regime anchors explicitly labelled)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (binding constraint): U.S. is in a growth-floor / labour-cooling regime. The binding constraint for policy is the labour slack trajectory versus core/services inflation persistence, not the level of headline activity.

What changed in this window (delta):

Policy: Fed delivered a 25bp cut in Dec 2025 and framed it as “insurance” largely completed → pause is baseline unless labour/inflation deteriorate.

Liquidity implementation: reserve-management bill purchases (~$40bn first month / near term elevated) were announced as technical plumbing → reduces money-market tail risk but not a macro easing signal by itself.

Data quality / noise: shutdown-related distortions + revisions are a first-order issue for signal extraction.

What did not change:

Activity prints can look strong (GDP tracking / consumption), but labour is still cooling at the margin.

Inflation constraint is still core/services momentum, not headline.

Regime-change triggers:

Dovish acceleration: unemployment drifts above ~4.7% (user narrative) with corroboration (hours/wages/continuing claims trend).

Hawkish tail / pause-longer: core/services persistence reasserts; cuts get deferred.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Union-mode: ALL user-provided releases included; verification shown only via numbers that can be confirmed; otherwise “n/a (not verified)” or “(User input)” retained.)

Dec 2025 – Fed policy action + liquidity operations
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 25bp cut (User input) / n/a / prior n/a
Signal: Cut framed as “insurance” easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation (User input).
HF take: Reaction function shifts to near-neutral plateau + conditionality; market should not extrapolate a mechanical easing cycle.
Add-on (implementation): Reserve management purchases ~“$40bn first month / near term elevated” (User input).
HF take: Technical support to keep reserves ample; reduces funding-tail risk, but is not QE-by-intent.

Late 2025 – Real activity / GDP tracking
3Q GDP: ~3.5% q/q saar (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Upside risks to near-term growth tracking (User input); composition flagged as trade/inventories (User input).
HF take: Growth floor can coexist with labour cooling; quality/composition matters more than headline.

Nov 2025 – CPI (User input summary)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: Headline ~+0.3% m/m (User input); Core ~+0.27–0.30% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Mixed inflation signals; shutdown-related distortions and rebound risk (User input).
HF take: The Fed’s pause is consistent with inflation noise: it wants confirmation on core/services momentum before moving again.

Labour – unemployment / openings / quits / claims (composite)
Unemployment: ~4.6% in late 2025 (User input); peak read ~4.7% early 2026 (User narrative) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Cooling but not collapsing (User input).
HF take: This supports “pause” unless corroborated by hours/wage cooling or a sustained rise in continuing claims.

Initial claims: ~220k week ending Dec 13 (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Elevated vs cyclical troughs (~200–220k) (User input).
HF take: Claims are above trough but still consistent with low layoffs; labour cooling is more about hiring.

Nov 2025 — Pending Home Sales
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +3.3% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Strong gain, highest since Feb 2023 (User input).
HF take: Housing is stabilising off depressed levels; contributes to the “growth floor,” but does not negate labour cooling.

(Additional user-provided level): Pending home sales ~77.5 (mn ar) (User input)
HF note: Level metric is kept as provided; treated as non-core because definition/units vary.

Nov 2025 — Average weekly workweek
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 34.3 hours (Nov) (User input); expected 34.2 (Dec) (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Hours stable over ~18 months (User input).
HF take: Hours are a high-signal labour margin; stability argues against abrupt recession, but a downshift would be an early dovish trigger.

Late 2025 — Payroll prints and revisions
Actual / Consensus / Prior: “first-round revisions tended negative” (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Revision risk can materially change initial payroll reads (User input).
HF take: Under a pause regime, tighten the filter: do not overweight first prints if revision/collection noise is elevated.

Dec 2025 – PMIs (S&P Global; user summary)
All-industry output: 53.0 (User input); prior 54.2 (User input)
Services business activity: 52.9 (User input)
New business: 54.3 (User input)
Services prices: “cycle highs” (User input)
Manufacturing composite: 51.8 (User input)
Signal: Growth slowed but remains expansionary; prices pressures concentrated in services (User input).
HF take: Consistent with growth floor + services inflation constraint → reinforces “pause.”

Nov 2025 – Retail sales
Control group: +0.5% m/m (User input)
Headline: ~−0.1% m/m (User input) (autos timing)
Signal: Underlying consumption resilient despite headline dip.
HF take: Supports near-term activity; makes labour the main pivot for further cuts.

Dec 2025 – Philadelphia Fed
General conditions: “positive; components mixed” (User input)
Signal: Regional activity steady but uneven.
HF take: Secondary sentinel: supportive, not decisive versus labour/inflation constraint.

Top-Down Macro

Hierarchy (HF compression):

Policy reaction function is the regime anchor: cut-to-near-neutral then pause unless labour slack accelerates or inflation persistence breaks the other way.

Labour is the binding constraint: unemployment drifting higher + openings/quits moderating; watch hours and continuing claims for confirmation.

Inflation remains noisy: services prices / core momentum are the key; shutdown/revision noise raises the threshold for reacting to any single print.

Activity is a floor, not a green light: retail/control + PMI expansion suggest no imminent recession, but composition/revision issues keep conviction capped.

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS “growth floor + labour cooling,” with convexity in labour drift vs services inflation persistence.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

FOMC (Dec 2025)
Policy decision: 25bp cut (User input); stance framed as near-neutral with high optionality.
Rationale: insurance easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation.
Projections: n/a (not required for this rerun; not verified in user text).

Rolling communications (include-boilerplate ON; discipline > omission)

Powell (Chair) – Dec 2025 (press conference)
Core message: pause baseline; data-dependent; separated liquidity ops from stance.
Bias: neutral-to-cautious.
Adds/changes: institutionalises pause and raises the bar for sequential cuts.

FOMC Minutes – Dec 2025
Core message: finely balanced; uncertainty elevated; implementation/reserves discussed.
Bias: neutral (distribution-aware).
Adds/changes: strengthens “pause can persist” even after a cut.

(Other speakers in rolling month)

Included only if dated, policy-relevant and verified; otherwise excluded to avoid false precision.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

In-window: No verified market-moving fiscal/political shock in the user input beyond shutdown-related data distortion risk.
Rolling: data-quality risk raises uncertainty premia; does not mechanically shift macro baseline.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: front-end anchored by “cut-to-neutral then pause”; sensitivity highest to labour confirmation (hours/claims/UE drift) and services inflation momentum.
USD: supported by growth floor and pause optionality; downside if labour drift forces earlier/steeper cut path.
