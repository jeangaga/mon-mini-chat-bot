Date: 2 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Window: last 4 weeks into year-end 2025 (with regime anchors explicitly labelled)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (binding constraint): U.S. is in a growth-floor / labour-cooling regime. The binding constraint for policy is the labour slack trajectory versus core/services inflation persistence, not the level of headline activity.

What changed in this window (delta):

Policy: Fed delivered a 25bp cut in Dec 2025 and framed it as “insurance” largely completed → pause is baseline unless labour/inflation deteriorate.

Liquidity implementation: reserve-management bill purchases (~$40bn first month / near term elevated) were announced as technical plumbing → reduces money-market tail risk but not a macro easing signal by itself.

Data quality / noise: shutdown-related distortions + revisions are a first-order issue for signal extraction.

What did not change:

Activity prints can look strong (GDP tracking / consumption), but labour is still cooling at the margin.

Inflation constraint is still core/services momentum, not headline.

Regime-change triggers:

Dovish acceleration: unemployment drifts above ~4.7% (user narrative) with corroboration (hours/wages/continuing claims trend).

Hawkish tail / pause-longer: core/services persistence reasserts; cuts get deferred.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Union-mode: ALL user-provided releases included; verification shown only via numbers that can be confirmed; otherwise “n/a (not verified)” or “(User input)” retained.)

Dec 2025 – Fed policy action + liquidity operations
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 25bp cut (User input) / n/a / prior n/a
Signal: Cut framed as “insurance” easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation (User input).
HF take: Reaction function shifts to near-neutral plateau + conditionality; market should not extrapolate a mechanical easing cycle.
Add-on (implementation): Reserve management purchases ~“$40bn first month / near term elevated” (User input).
HF take: Technical support to keep reserves ample; reduces funding-tail risk, but is not QE-by-intent.

Late 2025 – Real activity / GDP tracking
3Q GDP: ~3.5% q/q saar (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Upside risks to near-term growth tracking (User input); composition flagged as trade/inventories (User input).
HF take: Growth floor can coexist with labour cooling; quality/composition matters more than headline.

Nov 2025 – CPI (User input summary)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: Headline ~+0.3% m/m (User input); Core ~+0.27–0.30% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Mixed inflation signals; shutdown-related distortions and rebound risk (User input).
HF take: The Fed’s pause is consistent with inflation noise: it wants confirmation on core/services momentum before moving again.

Labour – unemployment / openings / quits / claims (composite)
Unemployment: ~4.6% in late 2025 (User input); peak read ~4.7% early 2026 (User narrative) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Cooling but not collapsing (User input).
HF take: This supports “pause” unless corroborated by hours/wage cooling or a sustained rise in continuing claims.

Initial claims: ~220k week ending Dec 13 (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Elevated vs cyclical troughs (~200–220k) (User input).
HF take: Claims are above trough but still consistent with low layoffs; labour cooling is more about hiring.

Nov 2025 — Pending Home Sales
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +3.3% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Strong gain, highest since Feb 2023 (User input).
HF take: Housing is stabilising off depressed levels; contributes to the “growth floor,” but does not negate labour cooling.

(Additional user-provided level): Pending home sales ~77.5 (mn ar) (User input)
HF note: Level metric is kept as provided; treated as non-core because definition/units vary.

Nov 2025 — Average weekly workweek
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 34.3 hours (Nov) (User input); expected 34.2 (Dec) (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Hours stable over ~18 months (User input).
HF take: Hours are a high-signal labour margin; stability argues against abrupt recession, but a downshift would be an early dovish trigger.

Late 2025 — Payroll prints and revisions
Actual / Consensus / Prior: “first-round revisions tended negative” (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Revision risk can materially change initial payroll reads (User input).
HF take: Under a pause regime, tighten the filter: do not overweight first prints if revision/collection noise is elevated.

Dec 2025 – PMIs (S&P Global; user summary)
All-industry output: 53.0 (User input); prior 54.2 (User input)
Services business activity: 52.9 (User input)
New business: 54.3 (User input)
Services prices: “cycle highs” (User input)
Manufacturing composite: 51.8 (User input)
Signal: Growth slowed but remains expansionary; prices pressures concentrated in services (User input).
HF take: Consistent with growth floor + services inflation constraint → reinforces “pause.”

Nov 2025 – Retail sales
Control group: +0.5% m/m (User input)
Headline: ~−0.1% m/m (User input) (autos timing)
Signal: Underlying consumption resilient despite headline dip.
HF take: Supports near-term activity; makes labour the main pivot for further cuts.

Dec 2025 – Philadelphia Fed
General conditions: “positive; components mixed” (User input)
Signal: Regional activity steady but uneven.
HF take: Secondary sentinel: supportive, not decisive versus labour/inflation constraint.

Top-Down Macro

Hierarchy (HF compression):

Policy reaction function is the regime anchor: cut-to-near-neutral then pause unless labour slack accelerates or inflation persistence breaks the other way.

Labour is the binding constraint: unemployment drifting higher + openings/quits moderating; watch hours and continuing claims for confirmation.

Inflation remains noisy: services prices / core momentum are the key; shutdown/revision noise raises the threshold for reacting to any single print.

Activity is a floor, not a green light: retail/control + PMI expansion suggest no imminent recession, but composition/revision issues keep conviction capped.

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS “growth floor + labour cooling,” with convexity in labour drift vs services inflation persistence.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

FOMC (Dec 2025)
Policy decision: 25bp cut (User input); stance framed as near-neutral with high optionality.
Rationale: insurance easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation.
Projections: n/a (not required for this rerun; not verified in user text).

Rolling communications (include-boilerplate ON; discipline > omission)

Powell (Chair) – Dec 2025 (press conference)
Core message: pause baseline; data-dependent; separated liquidity ops from stance.
Bias: neutral-to-cautious.
Adds/changes: institutionalises pause and raises the bar for sequential cuts.

FOMC Minutes – Dec 2025
Core message: finely balanced; uncertainty elevated; implementation/reserves discussed.
Bias: neutral (distribution-aware).
Adds/changes: strengthens “pause can persist” even after a cut.

Included only if dated, policy-relevant and verified; otherwise excluded to avoid false precision.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

In-window: No verified market-moving fiscal/political shock in the user input beyond shutdown-related data distortion risk.
Rolling: data-quality risk raises uncertainty premia; does not mechanically shift macro baseline.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: front-end anchored by “cut-to-neutral then pause”; sensitivity highest to labour confirmation (hours/claims/UE drift) and services inflation momentum.
USD: supported by growth floor and pause optionality; downside if labour drift forces earlier/steeper cut path.
