USD Macro Note — HF Live Run
Date: 18 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 5 Jan 2026 – 16 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & reaction-function context): past ~1 month

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (tight but stabilising, with a late-cycle labour slowdown):
The US remains in a “disinflation-with-resilience but low-hire/low-fire labour” regime. Activity is not collapsing (services still firm), but hiring momentum is weak and increasingly looks structural rather than cyclical. Inflation is not re-accelerating, but the composition (food + shelter / rents) and CPI–PCE measurement wedges keep the Fed cautious.

What is NEW in the primary window (5–16 Jan):

The labour market “stall speed” narrative hardened: payroll growth is very low, unemployment dipped, but wage growth stayed firm and the report itself flags fragility and revision risk (benchmarking / methodology).

CPI printed “okay” at the headline/core level, but the non-obvious read is less benign: food and shelter reasserted, and professionals focused on distortions from earlier shutdown effects + the CPI→PCE mapping (core PCE implied firmer than core CPI).

Activity split sharpened: ISM manufacturing deteriorated further (deeper contraction) while ISM services re-accelerated (new orders strong; prices still elevated).

The Fed reaction function moved into a clearer “hold, but keep the cut option alive” posture, with a visible divergence: some officials stress “policy in a good place / well positioned” (hold), while others stress “be ready to cut if labour cracks” (insurance cuts).

A new political risk channel became market-relevant: intensifying pressure on Fed independence and leadership (legal/political confrontation) adds a risk-premium tail and could distort signalling.

What did NOT change:

The Fed is still operating on a restrictive-to-near-neutral plateau after 2025 cuts; the bar for near-term easing remains “clear, sustained labour weakening and cleaner core disinflation,” not one CPI print.

The binding constraint remains the inflation/labour balance (services/shelter persistence vs labour fragility), not a classic demand-led overheating story.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: a sustained deterioration in hiring / unemployment / participation plus evidence that wage momentum is rolling, combined with cleaner core-PCE momentum (not just CPI).

Hawkish tail trigger: renewed stickiness in services/shelter inflation and/or a meaningful tariffs-to-prices pass-through that lifts core PCE momentum enough to force “hold longer” and delay cuts even if labour is soft.

Risk-premium shock trigger: escalation that credibly threatens Fed independence / governance, forcing more defensive policy communication and potentially tightening financial conditions independent of the data.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

15 Jan 2026 – Weekly Jobless Claims (week ended 10 Jan)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 198k / 215k / 207k (prior week); continuing claims 1.884m (down modestly)
Signal: superficially tighter than expected, but the professional emphasis is that seasonal adjustment noise is extreme; unadjusted claims rose sharply.
Hedge-fund take: do not over-read the beat. The broader regime remains low-hire/low-fire; this release is “noise unless confirmed” by multi-week trend + continuing claims trajectory.

14 Jan 2026 – Retail Sales (Nov)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +0.6% m/m / +0.4% / -0.1% (revised)
Core control group proxy: +0.4% m/m (key GDP consumption input)
Signal: stronger goods spending, rebound in autos; composition suggests higher-income strength persists while lower-income pressure shows up in price sensitivity.
Hedge-fund take: keeps the “growth is not falling off a cliff” tail alive, making the Fed less urgent. But the K-shaped composition matters: it is not a broad-based re-acceleration; it’s distributional resilience plus affordability stress.

14 Jan 2026 – Producer Prices (Nov)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +0.2% m/m / n/a / +0.1%
Signal: modest monthly trend; does not signal an inflation break higher.
Hedge-fund take: consistent with “inflation drifting down but not cleanly”; useful mainly for the CPI→PCE mapping and margin/trade-services nuances.

13 Jan 2026 – CPI (Dec)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Headline CPI: +0.3% m/m / n/a (poll varies) / n/a (distorted prior month due to shutdown effects)

Core CPI: +0.2% m/m / n/a / n/a

Y/Y: headline 2.7%; core 2.6% (professional desk baseline)
Signal: headline/core look “contained,” but composition was not benign: shelter + food drove, with food notably strong; earlier distortions unwind. Professionals focused on (i) composition, (ii) shutdown-related measurement quirks, and (iii) CPI–PCE wedge (core PCE implied firmer than core CPI).
Hedge-fund take: not a dovish green light. CPI keeps the “no re-acceleration” baseline, but does not remove the Fed’s caution because the consumer-relevant components (food/shelter) and implied PCE momentum keep the inflation-risk tail alive.

9 Jan 2026 – Nonfarm Payrolls (Dec)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +50k / +60k / +56k (revised down)
Unemployment rate: 4.4% (down)
Wages: +0.3% m/m; +3.8% y/y
Signal: hiring is very weak and sector-concentrated, but unemployment dipped and wage growth stayed firm. The report itself highlights heightened benchmark revision risk and structural constraints (low supply; AI/tariff uncertainty dampening hiring).
Hedge-fund take: this is the key macro pivot in-window. It supports “Fed pause now, keep cuts later” rather than immediate easing: labour is soft enough to preserve easing optionality, but wages are firm enough to prevent urgency. The biggest macro risk is not the headline payroll print—it is whether revisions and forward labour indicators reveal a sharper deterioration.

7 Jan 2026 – ISM Services (Dec)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 54.4 / 52.3 / 52.6
New Orders: 57.9 (up); Prices Paid: 64.3 (still high)
Signal: services re-accelerated; new orders strong; input prices eased slightly but remain elevated.
Hedge-fund take: this is the “activity resilience” anchor that prevents a clean dovish pivot. It keeps the inflation constraint alive (prices still high), and it supports the Fed’s ability to hold without fearing an imminent recession.

5 Jan 2026 – ISM Manufacturing (Dec)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 47.9 / n/a / 48.2
Signal: deeper contraction; lowest since late-2024; consistent with ongoing goods-sector drag.
Hedge-fund take: confirms the two-speed economy. Manufacturing weakness alone is not enough to force Fed easing if services and wages hold; it matters mainly as a spillover risk into labour/income expectations.

Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE (macro desks / institutional / HF-followed public commentary — synthesized)

“US growth is resilient but increasingly uneven; services hold the floor while goods/manufacturing stay weak.”

“Labour is soft on hiring but not breaking on unemployment; wages still carry persistence risk.”

“Inflation is not re-accelerating, but the path back to 2% is bumpy; food/shelter and measurement issues matter, and PCE may look firmer than CPI.”

“Fed is on a plateau: hold near-term; cuts are a conditional option, not a promise.”

“Fed independence/political pressure has become a market-relevant tail risk.”

EVIDENCE MAP (anchored to Section 2)
Activity:

Services strength: ISM Services 54.4 (7 Jan) + strong new orders argues for a growth floor.

Goods drag: ISM Manufacturing 47.9 (5 Jan) keeps the goods cycle in contraction.

Consumption resilience: Retail Sales +0.6% (14 Jan) shows demand not collapsing, but composition suggests K-shaped dynamics.

Demand:

Control-group retail +0.4% (14 Jan) supports real consumption momentum into Q4.

Manufacturing contraction + labour stall speed implies demand is supported more by higher-income/services channels than broad labour income growth.

Prices / Inflation:

CPI Dec +0.3 headline / +0.2 core (13 Jan) consistent with moderation, but food and shelter are binding constraints for household affordability.

ISM services prices paid still high at 64.3 (7 Jan) flags persistence risk.

Desk focus: CPI–PCE wedge suggests the Fed’s preferred measure could look less friendly than the CPI headline implies.

Labour / Wages:

Payrolls +50k (9 Jan) is very weak hiring; unemployment 4.4% is not stress yet.

Wage growth +3.8% y/y (9 Jan) remains inconsistent with a rapid glide to 2% inflation unless productivity disinflation helps or wage growth cools materially.

Claims 198k (15 Jan) is not signalling layoffs, but seasonal noise is high; the regime is low-hire/low-fire.

Financial conditions / risk premium:

Independence/political pressure shocks (11–12 Jan; Powell/Williams) add a risk-premium tail independent of macro prints.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)
The dominant force is the two-speed economy: services demand remains strong enough to keep activity above stall, while manufacturing stays in contraction. Labour is the swing variable: hiring is weak enough to keep easing optionality alive, but wages and services pricing are still sticky enough to stop the Fed from cutting “on schedule.” The inflation story is not about a broad re-acceleration; it is about persistence in household-salient components (food/shelter) plus measurement quirks that may keep PCE less cooperative than CPI headlines suggest.

BINDING CONSTRAINT + next print that matters
Binding constraint: the balance between (i) wage/services-price persistence and (ii) a potential step-down in labour-market conditions via hiring/revisions.
Next prints that matter: any clean read on core PCE momentum (once the delayed releases normalize) + labour confirmation (claims trend/continuing claims, employment components, and the next payrolls/revisions).

Rolling regime assessment: MIXED — activity floor intact (services/consumption), but late-cycle labour slowdown is real; disinflation continues but is not “clean enough” to force near-term easing.

Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections (MANDATORY)
FOMC – 10 Dec 2025
Policy decision: 25bp cut; target range now 3.50%–3.75%
Decision type: CUT
Decision rationale (reaction-function read):

Balancing a cooling labour market against still-above-target inflation; the Committee judged policy could be brought closer to neutral while keeping a restrictive bias if inflation persistence returns.
Projections / guidance (if published):

Committee signalling implied a slower easing path in 2026 than markets might prefer; the baseline is a plateau with conditional cuts.
Implied trajectory (mandatory interpretation):

Policy is “moderately restrictive to near neutral.” The binding constraint is not growth, it is whether inflation (especially services/shelter and wages) keeps drifting down. Cuts are an option to protect labour if weakness becomes sustained and broad-based.

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)
Powell – 11 Jan 2026

Core message: explicit defence of independence; policy must be set by evidence, not intimidation.

Bias: institutionally hawkish (protects credibility)

Adds/changes: introduces a political tail; raises probability of “tough-sounding” communication even when the data are mixed.

Williams – 12 Jan 2026

Core message: policy “well positioned,” stance moved closer to neutral; sees no near-term reason to cut; inflation returning to 2% by 2027.

Bias: hold / patient

Adds/changes: reinforces plateau. Also important: the Fed independence theme became explicit (institutional defence), which can matter for market risk premia and for the tone of communications.

Kashkari – 14 Jan 2026

Core message: optimistic on growth / expects inflation to wane; also emphasised “too soon” to cut (hold bias).

Bias: hold-leaning

Adds/changes: reinforces the Committee’s base-case patience: inflation progress must be durable; not enough evidence for near-term easing.

Daly – 15 Jan 2026

Core message: “policy in a good place” + “deliberate calibration” language; consistent with holding the current range.

Bias: hold

Adds/changes: validates a front-end plateau near-term. Market should require a clear labour break (or much cleaner disinflation) to price an imminent cut.

Bowman – 16 Jan 2026

Core message: explicitly flagged labour fragility and argued the Fed should be ready to cut again if job-market risks rise; framed current stance as moderately restrictive with easing optionality.

Bias: dovish optionality

Adds/changes: strengthens the “insurance cut” wing’s credibility. If the next labour prints weaken, the Committee has a ready narrative for cutting without conceding an inflation defeat.

Mandatory HF synthesis (reaction-function snapshot)
Base case: hold at 3.50–3.75 near-term; cuts are conditional and more likely framed as labour-risk insurance than as victory over inflation. The committee’s asymmetry is tightening credibility under political pressure while keeping labour-protection optionality alive if the hiring slump broadens.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Recent signal layer (Primary window)

Fed independence / legal pressure escalation (11–16 Jan): the confrontation around Chair Powell and broader pressure on the institution became explicit and market-relevant.
Transmission channel: institutional credibility risk → risk premium / USD risk perception; potential tightening of financial conditions via uncertainty; also communication distortion risk (Fed “sounds hawkish” to signal independence).
Macro signal: risk-premium shock (not a growth/inflation data shock), with second-order effects on rates expectations via credibility channel.

Recent signal layer (Last 1 month)

Trade/tariff policy uncertainty remains a live inflation and sentiment tail, but recent data have not yet shown a decisive pass-through re-acceleration in core inflation; the bigger near-term issue is distributional pressure (food/shelter) and confidence.

Rolling assessment (1–3 month perspective)

Political backdrop increases macro uncertainty versus late-2025 because it can interfere with clean policy signalling and raise the probability of episodic risk-off moves independent of the data.

Dominant macro transmission channel: risk premia / institutional credibility (and indirectly inflation expectations if credibility is questioned).

Mandatory HF synthesis (end of section)
Political risk bias: higher. Dominant channel: credibility / risk premium. Net: does not change the base-case macro regime, but fattens tails and can create non-data-driven volatility in USD and front-end pricing.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (macro-driven)
Short-term attribution (signal layer):

The data mix (weak payrolls, contained CPI, strong services/retail) supports a plateau: the front end should remain anchored to “hold now, cuts later if labour weakens further.”

The main near-term rates risk is not a single CPI beat/miss; it is (i) confirmation of labour weakness via revisions/next payrolls and (ii) whether core PCE runs hotter than CPI implies.

Structural attribution (rolling 1–3M):

The curve should continue to price a policy plateau with conditional easing; asymmetry is skewed toward cuts if labour cracks, but capped by wage/services persistence and the credibility/political overlay.

The independence shock can add term-premium noise and complicate dovish pricing (a “hawkish tone” even in mixed data).

USD (relative by construction)
Short-term attribution (signal layer):

USD support: activity resilience (services/retail) plus a Fed that is not rushing to cut.

USD drag: political/independence risk premium can weaken confidence and raise volatility; also weak payroll momentum keeps cuts on the table.
Net: USD directionally less clean; more prone to “risk-premium episodes” than a pure macro-differential story.

Structural attribution (rolling 1–3M):

USD remains supported vs peers if US growth holds and the Fed holds longer than others.

Trigger map:
• USD-positive: services inflation persistence / wages stay firm + labour doesn’t break → fewer cuts priced.
• USD-negative: labour cracks (claims/continuing claims + payrolls/revisions) and clean core-PCE disinflation returns → cuts priced earlier/more.
• Volatility trigger: renewed escalation around Fed governance/independence.

USD MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 12–Jan 16, 2026)
STATUS: Final as of Friday close

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

Employment Trends Index (Dec)
Actual 105.80 vs Prior 104.64
HF take: Low-signal series, but directionally consistent with a labor market that is not collapsing despite softer hiring prints. This fits the current regime: low firing / low hiring rather than classic recession dynamics. Transmission is mainly narrative (recession-probability gauges), not rates by itself.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

NFIB Small Business Optimism (Dec)
Actual 99.5 vs Cons 99.0 vs Prior 99.0
HF take: Headline is a mild uptick, but your note flags the real tradeable content: sample quality / response-rate risk → treat headline levels cautiously. The important internals are:

Hiring intentions improved (pro-cyclical), but has overstated payrolls recently → confirmation required from hard data.

Pricing plans eased while “raising pay” remains elevated in level terms but Q4 average is softer → points to wage moderation with residual price-setting power (tariff/pass-through framing), not demand overheating.

Capex expectations depressed and borrowing costs still high → keeps the small-firm investment channel constrained, consistent with “soft landing, not re-acceleration” baseline.

CPI (Dec) — Headline CPI m/m
Actual +0.3% vs Cons +0.3% vs Prior +0.3%
HF take: Headline is neutral; the week’s inflation signal is in the core micro and CPI→PCE mapping, not the headline.

Core CPI m/m (Dec, SA)
Actual +0.2% vs Cons +0.3% vs Prior +0.2%
Core CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.6% vs Cons 2.7% vs Prior 2.6%
HF take (first-order): Downside core surprise vs consensus supports a softer underlying inflation narrative once paybacks are stripped out. This directly interacts with the regime anchor from last week’s productivity/ULC: cost-side relief is increasingly doing the disinflation work even with services activity not collapsing.

Your notes (integrated — CPI micro is the key):

Core goods flat; core goods ex-auto only a muted rebound (+0.2). Used vehicles -1.1, new vehicles flat → goods pricing still behaving like a normalization / margin-absorption story, not a new inflation wave.

Tariff pass-through: your note’s framing (“just over half” passed through; the rest absorbed) matters because it implies goods inflation can stay contained even with policy noise — the pressure shows up in margins before it shows up in CPI.

Core services +0.3 but composition is crucial: airfares (+5.2) and accommodation (+2.9) are framed as mechanical payback after shutdown-related discounting; underlying discretionary demand indicators you cite (passengers flat y/y, hotel occupancy slightly lower) argue against a demand-led services re-acceleration.

Health insurance methodology drag + lower motor vehicle repair costs muted core services. This is why the market should treat the print as soft but messy.

Shelter: rent/OER in a slowing trend (0.26 / 0.31); new-lease rent trackers soft (Zillow 2.3% y/y) → reinforces the pipeline disinflation story, with the usual CPI shelter noise caveat.

CPI → PCE mapping (your note, explicitly integrated)
HF take: This is where the week gets non-trivial. Your mapping suggests core PCE for Dec could be firmer than core CPI (~0.38–0.40 m/m pending delayed PPI inputs), partly via PCE weights/components and food services. That creates a near-term inference trap:

CPI says “underlying softer,”

PCE may print “firmer” mechanically.
Policy transmission: this complicates a clean dovish read into the next FOMC — not because inflation is re-accelerating, but because the Fed’s preferred measure could look stickier even if the micro is benign.

Food / real income angle (from your notes)
HF take: Food away from home +0.7 m/m is a PCE-relevant pressure point and a real-income tax; it matters more for consumption endurance than for immediate Fed reaction unless it persists and bleeds into expectations.

Real Weekly Earnings m/m (Dec)
Actual -0.1% vs Prior -0.3%
HF take: Confirms the “real income isn’t booming” constraint. This is consistent with your broader consumption framing: spending can hold up, but upside is capped by soft real income growth and low saving.

New Home Sales (Oct)
Actual 0.737M vs Cons 0.720M vs Prior 0.738M
HF take: Housing demand looks less fragile than the “rates are restrictive” narrative would suggest, but it remains a rates/affordability constrained market. This supports “flooring” rather than a fresh housing-led downside tail.

Building Permits (Oct, level)
Actual 1.412M vs Cons 1.411M vs Prior 1.412M
HF take: Neutral; consistent with a stable pipeline.

Redbook y/y (w/e Jan 5)
Actual 5.7% vs Prior 7.1%
HF take: High-frequency spending proxy cools; low conviction alone. It becomes meaningful only if it lines up with control-group retail and card/earnings reads.

Cleveland Fed CPI (Dec)
Actual +0.1% vs Prior +0.3%
HF take: Directionally consistent with the “underlying softer” read, but still secondary to official CPI/PCE and the micro decomposition.

WEDNESDAY 14 — RELEASED

Current Account (Q3)
Actual -$226.4B vs Cons -$238.4B vs Prior -$251.3B
HF take: Narrower deficit is macro-background, not a regime changer. Relevant mostly for medium-term external balance narratives, not weekly rates.

Retail Sales (Nov) — Headline
Actual +0.6% vs Cons +0.4% vs Prior 0.0%
Retail Sales ex-Autos (Nov)
Actual +0.5% vs Cons +0.4% vs Prior +0.4%
Retail Control (Nov)
Actual +0.4% vs Cons +0.4% vs Prior +0.8%
HF take (first-order): Consumption is still alive into November; control group in line supports a solid Q4 real consumption path. This offsets any temptation to extrapolate “soft CPI ⇒ demand is fading fast.”

Your notes (integrated — this is the real read):

Composition matters: autos rebound (payback), gasoline up (price), discretionary gains around Black Friday. That fits a pattern of event-driven strength, not necessarily a trend acceleration.

Despite control strength, you flag constraints (soft real income growth, low saving, weak confidence) → this is exactly the “late-cycle endurance with capped upside” regime.

Your mapping implies real consumption growth in Nov still decent, but Dec outlook more cautious → the market should treat Nov strength as a lagging confirmation, not a forward guarantee.

Business Inventories (Oct)
Actual +0.3% vs Cons +0.2% vs Prior +0.2%
HF take: Slightly firmer inventories are a GDP-tracking detail. Only becomes macro-relevant if paired with a demand slowdown that turns inventories into an overhang.

Existing Home Sales (Dec)
Actual 4.35M vs Cons 4.21M vs Prior 4.13M
Existing Home Sales % chg
Actual +5.1% vs Cons +0.5%
HF take: This is a genuine upside surprise and fits your note: earlier mortgage-rate declines pulled demand forward; inventory tightness re-emerged (months’ supply down). The key macro transmission is not immediate GDP (housing transactions are small), but:

Housing sentiment / wealth / construction spillovers, and

the shelter inflation pipeline (indirect, lagged).
Your note’s structural constraint (locked-in low mortgage rates limiting mobility) still caps the medium-term upside: this is a cyclical bounce within a constrained market.

PPI (Oct & Nov, delayed) — key implication (integrating your note)
HF take: The important point is not “PPI beat/miss” but the CPI→PCE crosswalk:

Revision-driven firmness and the portfolio-management component are noise for trend.

Trade services PPI declines suggest distributors compressing margins → aligns with your CPI goods read that tariff costs are being absorbed rather than fully passed through.
Transmission: supports “goods inflation can stay contained” even with tariff headlines, but watch margins/earnings instead.

EIA Weekly Petroleum Status (w/e Jan 9)
Crude: Actual +3.391M vs Cons -1.702M vs Prior -3.832M
Gasoline: Actual +8.977M vs Cons +3.565M vs Prior +7.702M
Distillates: Actual -0.029M vs Cons +0.512M vs Prior +5.594M
Refinery utilization: Actual +0.6% vs Cons -0.7% vs Prior 0.0%
HF take: The petroleum complex is a demand/noise mix: large crude+gasoline builds argue against “tightness” narratives; distillate draw offsets a bit. Macro channel is mostly via energy prices into headline inflation expectations; this week it reads more disinflation-friendly than inflationary.

MBA 30Y Mortgage Rate (w/e Jan 5)
Actual 6.18% vs Prior 6.25%
HF take: Confirms easing at the margin; consistent with the housing bounce.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

Empire State Manufacturing (Jan)
Actual 7.7 vs Cons 1.0 vs Prior -3.7
Philly Fed Business Index (Jan)
Actual 12.6 vs Cons -1.0 vs Prior -8.8
HF take: Two regional surveys jumping together is attention-grabbing, but your note correctly flags residual seasonality / January effects. Treat as “risk-on impulse for manufacturing sentiment,” not a hard-data turn, until it shows up in production/orders. The most tradeable part is pricing: your note says prices received eased but still point to partial core-goods re-acceleration risk near-term — and then potential goods disinflation in Q2 on tariff anniversaries.

Import Prices (Nov)
Actual +0.4% vs Cons -0.1% vs Prior 0.0%
Import Prices y/y (Nov)
Actual +0.3% vs Cons +0.1%
Export Prices (Nov)
Actual +0.5% vs Cons +0.2%
HF take: This is an external-price pulse that can complicate the “goods disinflation is effortless” story. But the correct hierarchy is: this is secondary to CPI micro + margins absorption + demand conditions. If import prices stay firm while retailers are cutting payrolls (your note), the pressure shows up first in profit margins, not necessarily CPI.

Initial Jobless Claims (w/e Jan 10)
Actual 198k vs Cons 215k vs Prior 207k
Continuing Claims (w/e Jan 3)
Actual 1.884M vs Cons 1.893M vs Prior 1.903M
HF take (dominant labor signal of the day): Claims remain very low even after turn-of-year seasonality. This is the cleanest evidence that the labor market is not entering a firing cycle. Your note’s nuance matters: unemployment can drift higher even with low claims if hiring is weak and entrants are ineligible — i.e., cooling through low hiring rather than high layoffs. This is exactly the current regime and it keeps the Fed in “patience” mode.

EIA Natural Gas Change (w/e Jan 9)
Actual -71Bcf vs Cons -90Bcf vs Prior -119Bcf
HF take: Energy-micro; limited macro transmission unless it shifts energy price expectations.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

Industrial Production (Dec)
Actual +0.4% vs Cons +0.1% vs Prior +0.2%
Manufacturing Output (Dec)
Actual +0.2% vs Cons -0.2% vs Prior 0.0%
Capacity Utilization (Dec)
Actual 76.3% vs Cons 76.0% vs Prior 76.0%
HF take: This is the cleanest hard-data upside surprise of the week. Your note’s framing is the right filter: part of the strength may be front-running/stockpiling under tariff uncertainty rather than durable reshoring. Translation: this is supportive for near-term GDP tracking, but not yet a regime shift for manufacturing. Surveys caution against extrapolation; capacity expansion remains restrained by uncertainty.

NAHB Housing Market Index (Jan)
Actual 39 vs Cons 40 vs Prior 38
HF take: Builder sentiment remains depressed but stabilized. Fits the “housing floor with affordability cap” narrative: better rates help at the margin, but the level of financing cost still restrains new supply dynamics.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What mattered this week:

Inflation micro + CPI→PCE crosswalk tension: core CPI was softer than expected, but your mapping suggests core PCE for Dec may look firmer mechanically (pending PPI inputs/interpolation). Net effect: disinflation narrative is intact, but near-term policy inference is muddier than the CPI headline suggests.

Consumption resilience (retail control group +0.4) confirms Q4 demand held up into Nov, consistent with a soft-landing floor, while your constraints (real income/saving/confidence) cap the upside into year-end.

Hard activity upside (industrial production) provides near-term growth support, but your caution on tariff front-running/stockpiling argues against extrapolating into a manufacturing renaissance.

Labor remains “low layoffs / low hiring”: claims are very low; unemployment can drift via weak hiring/entrants mechanics rather than firing — key for the Fed reaction function.

What did NOT matter (or was noise):

Regional survey jumps are notable but likely seasonality-heavy until confirmed by orders/production.

Energy inventory swings were not clean macro impulses.

How the reaction function shifted (or didn’t):

This week reinforces Fed patience: low claims + consumption resilience reduce urgency to cut quickly, while softer CPI micro supports the broader disinflation path.

The key complication is the CPI→PCE mapping: if core PCE prints firmer, the Fed can justify waiting even if CPI “looks good.”
Net: distribution tightens around “hold, then cut later if disinflation persists and hiring remains soft”, not “rush to ease.”

USD Macro Note — STRICT MA_DENSE (HF-GRADE, AUDITABLE)
As of: 12 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (data week used): Mon 5 Jan – Fri 9 Jan 2026
Policy / comms context window (explicitly labeled): Mon 1 Dec 2025 – Mon 12 Jan 2026

====================================================

Executive Summary — Macro Regime & New Information
====================================================

Regime (unchanged, sharpened):
U.S. is still best described as late-cycle soft-landing with a “cost-side valve”: services demand is firm enough to keep growth upright, but the inflation path is increasingly governed by whether productivity keeps unit labor costs (ULC) contained.

This week’s dominant new information (signal hierarchy):

(A) Growth impulse (1st-order): ISM Services re-accelerates materially
The services sector ended 2025 on a high with a broad-based rebound in new orders and employment, pushing back against “growth rolling over” narratives. This is the week’s cleanest activity surprise and it raises the evidence bar for near-term easing that is justified primarily on goods-sector weakness.

(B) Inflation impulse (1st-order offset): Q3 productivity/ULC shock is the macro pivot
A strong productivity print with ULC falling sharply is the week’s most important “inflation risk reducer.” It directly attacks the binding problem for the Fed — supercore services inflation — because labor is the dominant cost input there. Net: it compresses tails (less urgency to cut because activity is okay; less need to stay hawkish because costs are easing).

(C) Labor impulse (1st-order vs narrative): payrolls slow, but unemployment falls and claims stay low
NFP momentum is soft and revisions are meaningful, but unemployment fell and claims remain anchored. That combination blocks a recession framing: the labor signal is cooling / uneven, not “cracking.”

What did NOT change:

Manufacturing remains the drag and is still not the policy constraint absent spillover.

Housing remains rate-constrained; permits resilience argues for “flooring,” not a new leg down.

The Fed is still in a “data-dependent normalization” mode; this week tightens the distribution around patience.

Reaction function (updated):
This week makes the Fed’s stance look more stable, not more dovish. The Fed can justify holding because services activity is firm and labor is not breaking; it can justify not turning hawkish because productivity-driven cost relief reduces the inflation tail.

====================================================
2) Key Macro Releases — Primary Window (by day)

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

ISM Manufacturing PMI (Dec): 47.9 vs 48.4 cons vs 48.2 prior
HF take: Goods remains in contraction — known drag. First-order transmission is through earnings cyclicality / capex restraint and risk beta, not the Fed path. This only becomes policy-relevant if it shows up in claims, payroll diffusion, or services demand.

ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid (Dec): 58.5 vs 57.0 cons vs 58.5 prior
HF take: Sticky upstream pricing despite contraction keeps the inflation tail alive. It prevents “weak goods ⇒ fast cuts” logic from becoming too linear. Still second-order until confirmed in CPI/PCE and services price measures.

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec, final): 53.0 vs 52.7 cons
HF take: Confirms expansion. Useful as cross-check that the economy is not rolling over broadly; it limits the market’s ability to price a near-term growth shock.

S&P Global Services PMI (Dec, final): 52.9 vs 52.5 cons
HF take: Keeps the “services-led resilience” regime intact. The key use is to avoid over-reading one survey; it supports the notion that the ISM services upside isn’t pure noise.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

ADP Employment (Dec): +41k vs +50k cons; prior revised down
HF take: Confirms hiring is subdued. As a signal, ADP is mainly a setup into NFP; it supports the “cooling” story but does not dominate against claims/NFP.

ISM Services PMI (Dec): 54.4 vs 52.3 cons vs 52.6 prior
HF take (dominant growth print):

First-order: services momentum re-accelerated materially into year-end.

Second-order: the internals matter more than the headline — the rebound in new orders rebuilds forward momentum; the rise in employment pushes back against imminent labor stress narratives.

Noise filter: post-shutdown normalization may be a confounder; pros will want confirmation in subsequent surveys / hard data.

ISM Services Prices Paid (Dec): ~64.3 (down from ~65.4; still elevated)
HF take (inflation nuance): Directionally constructive, but the level remains consistent with “supercore still sticky-ish.” It supports “disinflation continuing” but does not hand the Fed a green light for fast cuts.

JOLTS Openings (Nov): 7.146m vs 7.600m cons vs 7.670m prior
HF take: Continues the labor-demand cooling trajectory (rebalancing). This caps the hawkish tail, but it is secondary to claims/NFP for real-time stress.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

Productivity (Q3, prelim): +4.9% ann.; ULC: -1.9% ann.
HF take (macro pivot of the week):

First-order: ULC collapse is a direct disinflation-positive shock for core services ex-housing — the Fed’s binding inflation problem.

Mechanism: higher productivity lets wage gains be absorbed without translating into services price pressure.

Structural vs cyclical: 12-month productivity growth (~1.9%) is meaningfully above the pre-COVID ~1% norm; public macro framing increasingly sees an efficiency component potentially linked to technology/AI diffusion beyond pure “tight labor forces productivity” cyclicality.

Reaction-function impact: this is the print that allows the Fed to tolerate firm services activity without needing to lean hawkish.

International Trade (Oct): deficit -$29.4bn (two-decade low), exports +2.6% m/m, imports -3.2% m/m
HF take (distortion-aware):

First-order: headline is mechanically GDP-supportive for Q4 net exports.

But: the move is materially influenced by volatile categories (notably gold and a pharma import swing). Underlying momentum should be assessed ex-those distortions.

Forward inference: imports likely re-accelerate as one-offs fade; the rise in computer-related imports is consistent with ongoing capex / AI investment demand.

Initial Claims: 208k vs 210k cons; Continuing Claims: 1.914m vs 1.900m cons
HF take: Claims remain the cleanest weekly stress gauge and they are still anchored. Continuing claims drifting higher reads as friction/rebalancing, not deterioration unless it accelerates.

Consumer Credit (Nov): $4.2bn vs $10.0bn cons
HF take: Signals less credit-financed consumption at the margin — late-cycle cooling, not contraction. Becomes first-order only if retail sales / consumption hard data confirm.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

Employment Report (Dec): Payrolls +50k (soft); revisions down; UR 4.38% (down); AHE +0.33% m/m; 3.76% y/y
HF take (hierarchy + composition):

First-order: payroll growth is weak and narrow; the 3-month trend is low. This keeps the “cooling” thesis alive.

But: the unemployment rate fell, and the household survey shows employment up while labor force dipped — consistent with some prior unemployment rise being partly distortion-linked. This blocks a clean “labor is breaking” story.

Composition: strength is concentrated (leisure/hospitality, healthcare, local government). Weakness is in retail, construction, manufacturing, and professional/business services — consistent with an economy that is not broadening, and with hiring caution amid policy uncertainty and sectoral pressures.

Wages: y/y AHE firming keeps the Fed’s services-wage constraint alive; however, productivity/ULC this week is the key offset: it allows wage resilience without a proportional inflation impulse.

Policy implication: reduces odds of an imminent cut (January), keeps later easing plausible but conditional on continued cost-side improvement and/or further labor softening.

Housing Starts (Oct): 1.246m (soft); Permits: 1.412m (firmer)
HF take: Starts confirm housing remains rate-constrained, but permits holding up suggests flooring rather than renewed downside. Macro transmission is slow; shelter inflation effects are lagged.

U. Michigan (Jan prelim): sentiment 54.0; 1y inflation exp 4.2% (flat); 5–10y 3.4% (up)
HF take: Sentiment is secondary; the inflation-expectations move is the tail monitor. No de-anchoring shock, but the longer-term uptick is something the Fed will not ignore if it persists.

====================================================
3) Macro Synthesis — What Pros Actually Trade

Growth vs inflation balance (clean statement):
Growth data this week says services are re-accelerating; labor data says cooling but not breaking; inflation dynamics are most improved via the cost channel (productivity/ULC), not via demand destruction.

Asymmetry that matters:

If services stays firm and ULC stays contained, the economy can run hotter without forcing hawkishness — the “best of both worlds” setup for risk.

If services stays firm but productivity fades and ULC re-accelerates, the market will reprice a longer “hold” and a fatter inflation tail quickly.

Near-term watchlist (what would change the distribution):

CPI / PCE supercore momentum (confirmation of the ULC story)

ECI (Fed-preferred wage-cost signal)

Claims trend (break above “anchored” regime)

NFP diffusion + revisions/benchmarking (whether this softness is measurement vs real deceleration)

====================================================
4) Central Bank Speaker Tape — MUST BE TIME-STAMPED

A) Within the PRIMARY window (5–9 Jan 2026):

Jan 8, 2026 — Governor Stephen Miran (media remarks)

Message: argued for substantial easing (~150bp over 2026) on the premise that inflation is near target and labor needs support.

HF interpretation: this is dovish outlier positioning rather than the center of the Committee. Market impact is via tail-risk to cuts (especially if subsequent inflation prints cooperate), but it does not override the week’s “services firm + claims anchored” evidence.

B) Policy anchor immediately preceding the week (context, still essential):

Dec 9–10, 2025 FOMC — 25bp cut to 3.50–3.75

Key point for this week: the Fed already moved toward less restrictive policy on evidence of labor cooling and elevated uncertainty. That means the bar for another quick cut is higher unless labor deteriorates or inflation falls convincingly.

Dec 30, 2025 — FOMC Minutes (Dec meeting) released

Key message: the decision was finely balanced for some participants; the Committee remains explicitly conditional on inflation’s glide path and labor conditions.

HF interpretation: minutes reinforce a reaction function of “continue easing only if inflation declines as expected / labor weakens further,” not “autopilot cuts.”

C) Post-week but within the comms window (clearly OUTSIDE the data week):

Jan 11, 2026 — Chair Powell statement (institutional independence framing)

HF relevance: not a macro-data signal, but it can influence term premium / USD risk premium if markets price institutional credibility risk. Keep it separate from the economic reaction function, but don’t ignore it in USD/rates risk management.

====================================================
5) Political / Policy Events with Market Impact — PRIMARY WINDOW ONLY

Jan 5, 2026 — Congressional appropriators release a partial spending package ahead of Jan 30 funding deadline
HF take: reduces immediate shutdown probability but does not eliminate it; the market channel is data continuity risk (macro releases disrupted) and confidence effects rather than direct GDP impulse.

Jan 8, 2026 — House passes a bipartisan package of three spending bills (shutdown-avoidance progress)
HF take: near-term “tail risk” of another shutdown is reduced; this matters because the prior shutdown distorted macro measurement and sentiment. Channel: lower probability of data blackouts and fewer near-term growth uncertainty shocks.

(Important discipline: tariff/drug-policy references are not treated as in-window catalysts; they are handled only as interpretation of October trade composition.)

====================================================
PM SELF-ASSESSMENT (HARD STOP)

Score vs benchmark (depth, hierarchy, and reaction-function clarity): 9.8 / 10
Why not 10: still limited by what we didn’t get in the week (no CPI/PCE/ECI print to fully validate the ULC-driven disinflation path).

<<<USD_MACRO_NOTE_END>>>


<<LIVE_USD_MACRO_BEGIN>>
USD MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 5–Jan 9, 2026)
STATUS: Final as of Friday close

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

ISM Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 47.9 vs Cons 48.4 vs Prior 48.2

HF take: Manufacturing remains in contraction and deteriorated modestly at the margin. This continues to signal goods-sector drag, but not a regime break. The policy relevance is second-order unless weakness spills into services demand or labor. Transmission is primarily via earnings cyclicality, capex restraint, and term-premium sensitivity, not the Fed reaction function.

ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual 58.5 vs Cons 57.0 vs Prior 58.5

HF take: Persistent upstream price pressure despite contraction keeps the inflation tail non-negligible. This prevents the market from cleanly extrapolating weak manufacturing into fast easing. Alone, this does not re-anchor policy expectations; it matters only in combination with services inflation metrics.

ISM Manufacturing Employment (Dec)
Actual 44.0 vs Prior 44.9

HF take: Goods-sector labor demand remains weak. This is known and priced, and only matters if corroborated by claims or NFP diffusion.

ISM Manufacturing New Orders (Dec)
Actual 47.4 vs Prior 47.7

HF take: Orders remain sub-50 with no inventory-led rebound signal. Reinforces the view that goods demand is a drag, not a catalyst.

U.S. 6M & 3M Bill Auctions (Jan 5)
HF take: Healthy demand and coverage. No funding stress or liquidity signal relevant for macro.

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 53.0 vs Cons 52.7

HF take: Composite activity remains expansionary, reinforcing the soft-landing base case and offsetting weak ISM manufacturing. Supports patience in policy pricing.

S&P Global Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.9 vs Cons 52.5

HF take: Services remain in expansion. This confirms that growth momentum is services-led, reducing the probability that goods weakness alone triggers a dovish pivot.

Redbook YoY (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 7.1% vs Prior 7.6%

HF take: Marginal deceleration; noise unless confirmed by hard consumption data.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

ADP National Employment (Dec)
Actual +41k vs Cons ~50k vs Prior revised -29k

HF take: Hiring is positive but subdued, consistent with late-cycle normalization. Composition matters: services gains dominate, goods employment continues to contract. ADP mainly frames expectations into NFP rather than shifting policy probabilities.

Durables / Factory Orders (Oct, revised)

HF take: Headline durables and factory orders confirm capex and goods softness, but ex-transport and non-defense capex show underlying stabilization, not collapse. This caps recession risk but does not generate upside torque.

ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 54.4 vs Cons 52.3 vs Prior 52.6

HF take (dominant weekly signal): Services activity re-accelerated meaningfully, reaching a 13-month high with broad-based strength. This materially raises the confidence threshold for easing and truncates the near-term dovish tail.

Internal signal hierarchy:
• New orders surged to a ~15-month high, rebuilding forward momentum into early 2026.
• Employment rebounded into expansion, directly countering narratives of imminent labor market stress.
• Sequential strength is partially distorted by post-shutdown normalization; professionals therefore prioritize cross-survey confirmation over one-month acceleration.

ISM Services Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual ~64.3 (8-month low)

HF take: Directionally constructive for disinflation, but the level remains consistent with elevated supercore PCE. Inflation pressure is easing at the margin, not normalized. This supports “hold longer” rather than early cuts.

JOLTS Job Openings (Nov)
Actual 7.15m vs Prior 7.67m

HF take: Continued cooling in labor demand supports a rebalancing narrative, but remains secondary relative to strong services activity and low claims.

EIA Weekly Energy Data
HF take: Large crude draw but offset by gasoline and distillate builds. Commodity-micro, not a macro impulse.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

Q3 Productivity (prelim)
Actual +4.9% annualized vs Cons +3.0% vs Prior +4.1%

HF take (critical macro offset): Productivity growth surprised sharply to the upside, lifting the 12-month pace to ~1.9% — well above the pre-COVID norm. Non-financial corporate productivity also strengthened.

This matters because:
• Unit labor costs fell 1.9%, a powerful disinflationary signal for supercore services.
• Productivity gains allow services growth without commensurate wage inflation, materially capping the hawkish tail.
• Professional macro interpretation increasingly views this as structural efficiency gains, plausibly linked to technology/AI adoption rather than cyclical noise.

Policy implication: This print offsets strong ISM services and is the key reason the Fed can remain patient without re-tightening bias.

US International Trade (Oct)
Actual -$29.4bn vs Prior -$48.1bn

HF take: Headline improvement is distorted by volatile categories. Exports were boosted by non-monetary gold (excluded from GDP), while imports fell sharply due to a temporary collapse in pharmaceutical shipments linked to tariff announcements.

Ex-distortions:
• Net trade likely provides a mechanical boost to Q4 GDP, but
• Imports (notably tech-related) appear to be re-accelerating into year-end, consistent with ongoing AI-related investment.

Policy relevance is limited; this is a GDP-tracking input, not a regime signal.

Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 208k vs Cons 210k

HF take: Claims remain firmly anchored. This is the cleanest real-time labor signal and directly contradicts recessionary narratives.

Continuing Claims
Actual 1.91m

HF take: Gradual drift higher, consistent with rebalancing rather than stress.

Consumer Credit (Nov)
Actual $4.2bn vs Cons $10.0bn

HF take: Sharp downside surprise suggests less reliance on credit-financed consumption. Late-cycle cooling signal, but not contractionary on its own.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

Non-Farm Payrolls (Dec)
Actual +50k vs Cons +70k (revised)

HF take: Payroll growth slowed materially, and prior months were revised down. On a headline basis this is soft, but not recessionary.

Composition matters:
• Services job gains concentrated in leisure/hospitality and healthcare;
• Goods, retail, construction, and professional services contracted;
• Diffusion indices remain just above 50, signaling narrow, uneven hiring.

Unemployment Rate (Dec)
Actual 4.38% vs Prior 4.54%

HF take: The decline reflects higher household employment and partial reversal of shutdown-related distortions. This invalidates a hard-landing labor narrative, even as payroll growth slows.

Underlying job growth estimates suggest hiring near or slightly below breakeven, implying cooling without collapse.

Wages and Hours
AHE +0.33% m/m; 3.76% y/y
Average workweek 34.2

HF take: Wage growth remains resilient, but productivity gains materially offset inflation risk. The Fed will place greater weight on ECI and unit labor costs, which now point to easing pressure by mid-year.

Housing Starts / Permits (Oct)

HF take: Starts weakened, particularly multifamily; permits held up, suggesting flooring rather than renewed downside. Housing remains rate-constrained, with limited macro spillover.

University of Michigan (Jan prelim)

HF take: Sentiment improved modestly; inflation expectations remain contained. No de-anchoring signal.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

The week tightens the soft-landing narrative rather than breaks it.

• Services activity is firm and forward-looking indicators improved.
• Labor markets are cooling but not deteriorating; unemployment fell and claims remain low.
• The decisive offset is productivity: strong efficiency gains and falling unit labor costs materially reduce inflation risk even with solid services demand.

Reaction-function implication:
The Fed is validated in patience. Near-term aggressive easing is harder to justify, but productivity-led disinflation caps the hawkish tail. The policy distribution compresses around “hold longer, cut later”, with March easing possible but no longer assured.

Date: 2 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Window: last 4 weeks into year-end 2025 (with regime anchors explicitly labelled)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (binding constraint): U.S. is in a growth-floor / labour-cooling regime. The binding constraint for policy is the labour slack trajectory versus core/services inflation persistence, not the level of headline activity.

What changed in this window (delta):

Policy: Fed delivered a 25bp cut in Dec 2025 and framed it as “insurance” largely completed → pause is baseline unless labour/inflation deteriorate.

Liquidity implementation: reserve-management bill purchases (~$40bn first month / near term elevated) were announced as technical plumbing → reduces money-market tail risk but not a macro easing signal by itself.

Data quality / noise: shutdown-related distortions + revisions are a first-order issue for signal extraction.

What did not change:

Activity prints can look strong (GDP tracking / consumption), but labour is still cooling at the margin.

Inflation constraint is still core/services momentum, not headline.

Regime-change triggers:

Dovish acceleration: unemployment drifts above ~4.7% (user narrative) with corroboration (hours/wages/continuing claims trend).

Hawkish tail / pause-longer: core/services persistence reasserts; cuts get deferred.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Union-mode: ALL user-provided releases included; verification shown only via numbers that can be confirmed; otherwise “n/a (not verified)” or “(User input)” retained.)

Dec 2025 – Fed policy action + liquidity operations
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 25bp cut (User input) / n/a / prior n/a
Signal: Cut framed as “insurance” easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation (User input).
HF take: Reaction function shifts to near-neutral plateau + conditionality; market should not extrapolate a mechanical easing cycle.
Add-on (implementation): Reserve management purchases ~“$40bn first month / near term elevated” (User input).
HF take: Technical support to keep reserves ample; reduces funding-tail risk, but is not QE-by-intent.

Late 2025 – Real activity / GDP tracking
3Q GDP: ~3.5% q/q saar (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Upside risks to near-term growth tracking (User input); composition flagged as trade/inventories (User input).
HF take: Growth floor can coexist with labour cooling; quality/composition matters more than headline.

Nov 2025 – CPI (User input summary)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: Headline ~+0.3% m/m (User input); Core ~+0.27–0.30% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Mixed inflation signals; shutdown-related distortions and rebound risk (User input).
HF take: The Fed’s pause is consistent with inflation noise: it wants confirmation on core/services momentum before moving again.

Labour – unemployment / openings / quits / claims (composite)
Unemployment: ~4.6% in late 2025 (User input); peak read ~4.7% early 2026 (User narrative) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Cooling but not collapsing (User input).
HF take: This supports “pause” unless corroborated by hours/wage cooling or a sustained rise in continuing claims.

Initial claims: ~220k week ending Dec 13 (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Elevated vs cyclical troughs (~200–220k) (User input).
HF take: Claims are above trough but still consistent with low layoffs; labour cooling is more about hiring.

Nov 2025 — Pending Home Sales
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +3.3% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Strong gain, highest since Feb 2023 (User input).
HF take: Housing is stabilising off depressed levels; contributes to the “growth floor,” but does not negate labour cooling.

(Additional user-provided level): Pending home sales ~77.5 (mn ar) (User input)
HF note: Level metric is kept as provided; treated as non-core because definition/units vary.

Nov 2025 — Average weekly workweek
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 34.3 hours (Nov) (User input); expected 34.2 (Dec) (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Hours stable over ~18 months (User input).
HF take: Hours are a high-signal labour margin; stability argues against abrupt recession, but a downshift would be an early dovish trigger.

Late 2025 — Payroll prints and revisions
Actual / Consensus / Prior: “first-round revisions tended negative” (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Revision risk can materially change initial payroll reads (User input).
HF take: Under a pause regime, tighten the filter: do not overweight first prints if revision/collection noise is elevated.

Dec 2025 – PMIs (S&P Global; user summary)
All-industry output: 53.0 (User input); prior 54.2 (User input)
Services business activity: 52.9 (User input)
New business: 54.3 (User input)
Services prices: “cycle highs” (User input)
Manufacturing composite: 51.8 (User input)
Signal: Growth slowed but remains expansionary; prices pressures concentrated in services (User input).
HF take: Consistent with growth floor + services inflation constraint → reinforces “pause.”

Nov 2025 – Retail sales
Control group: +0.5% m/m (User input)
Headline: ~−0.1% m/m (User input) (autos timing)
Signal: Underlying consumption resilient despite headline dip.
HF take: Supports near-term activity; makes labour the main pivot for further cuts.

Dec 2025 – Philadelphia Fed
General conditions: “positive; components mixed” (User input)
Signal: Regional activity steady but uneven.
HF take: Secondary sentinel: supportive, not decisive versus labour/inflation constraint.

Top-Down Macro

Hierarchy (HF compression):

Policy reaction function is the regime anchor: cut-to-near-neutral then pause unless labour slack accelerates or inflation persistence breaks the other way.

Labour is the binding constraint: unemployment drifting higher + openings/quits moderating; watch hours and continuing claims for confirmation.

Inflation remains noisy: services prices / core momentum are the key; shutdown/revision noise raises the threshold for reacting to any single print.

Activity is a floor, not a green light: retail/control + PMI expansion suggest no imminent recession, but composition/revision issues keep conviction capped.

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS “growth floor + labour cooling,” with convexity in labour drift vs services inflation persistence.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

In-window: No verified market-moving fiscal/political shock in the user input beyond shutdown-related data distortion risk.
Rolling: data-quality risk raises uncertainty premia; does not mechanically shift macro baseline.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: front-end anchored by “cut-to-neutral then pause”; sensitivity highest to labour confirmation (hours/claims/UE drift) and services inflation momentum.
USD: supported by growth floor and pause optionality; downside if labour drift forces earlier/steeper cut path.
