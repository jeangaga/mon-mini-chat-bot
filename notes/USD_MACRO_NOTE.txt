US MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 5–11, 2026)
STATUS: Live as of Tuesday close
==================================================


MONDAY 05 JAN — RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------

WARDS TOTAL VEHICLE SALES (DEC)

Sales held close to the expected normalization band (~15.6–15.7mn SAAR).
Confirms stabilization rather than renewed weakness; EV credit pull-forward
did not create a post-credit cliff.
Macro relevance second-order: autos confirm demand resilience but provide
no upside impulse.
Fed lens: neutral to mildly hawkish (demand intact, no urgency to ease).


ISM MANUFACTURING (DEC) — 47.9

Headline: ISM manufacturing (Dec) 47.9 — below consensus (~48.4)
and below major forecasts (~48.5–48.7).
Prices paid: 58.5 — slightly below expectations (~58.7).

Production: 51.0 (expansion).
New orders: 47.7 (contraction).
Employment: 44.9 (up from 44.0 but still weak; comparable to 2019 levels).
Inventories: 45.2 (notable decline).
Supplier deliveries: 50.8 (modest increase).

Commentary was bleaker than the headline suggests; firms cited tariffs,
lower oil prices, weak housing starts, high interest rates, and resource
diversion to large projects as headwinds.
Input costs remain elevated despite lower oil, indicating broader cost
pressures in some areas.

The print was a touch worse than expectations and confirms manufacturing
lacked momentum at year-end.
Mixed signals: production >50 but new orders <50 and employment weak —
raising near-term downside risk for manufacturing.
Manufacturing softness alone is unlikely to prevent overall GDP growth,
given the larger roles of services and consumer spending.


TUESDAY 06 JAN — RELEASED
--------------------------------------------------

FED’S BARKIN SPEAKS — 08:00

What he said (synthesis, non-verbatim):
- Barkin emphasised patience and validation: policy is “well positioned”,
  but the Fed needs clean confirmation that inflation — especially services —
  is cooling before acting again.
- Explicit acknowledgement of two-sided risks:
  * upside risk from services price persistence
  * downside risk from labor softening via hiring restraint rather than layoffs

Professional framing (Reuters / Bloomberg / desks):
- Reuters highlighted Barkin’s focus on inflation credibility and his
  reluctance to extrapolate short-term disinflation prints.
- Bloomberg’s read was that Barkin sits squarely in the “pause camp”,
  reinforcing the idea that December’s cut was not the start of a
  mechanical easing cycle.

HF interpretation (what this ADDS):
- Barkin does not push back on the idea that labor could weaken further,
  but he also does not pre-commit to cuts.
- Net effect: narrows the distribution rather than shifting it.
- Reinforces that services inflation data, not manufacturing or headline
  GDP, is the binding constraint.

Reaction-function impact:
- Slightly hawkish-neutral at the margin: confirms that one or two soft
  prints will not be enough.
- Keeps front-end rates range-bound ahead of ISM Services / NFP.


S&P US SERVICES PMI (DEC FINAL) — 09:45

Result:
- Final print largely unchanged vs flash (~52.9).
- Business activity stable; new business still weak relative to mid-year;
  employment sub-index soft.

Professional read:
- Treated as confirmation, not a new signal.
- Momentum loss rather than contraction: services expanding at a slower pace.

HF interpretation:
- Confirms the baseline: services remain the growth anchor, but with
  cooling forward momentum.
- Does not contradict Monday’s ISM manufacturing weakness — preserves
  the two-speed economy narrative.


WEDNESDAY 07 JAN — LIVE (PREVIEW)
--------------------------------------------------

MBA MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS — 07:00

ADP EMPLOYMENT CHANGE (DEC) — 08:15
Consensus: modest gain.
Weekly ADP data showed a cumulative +~50k in the four weeks to Dec 6;
broader labor indicators mixed.

ISM SERVICES INDEX (DEC) — 10:00
Consensus: ~52.6.
Slight downshift toward ~52; employment index improved gradually but
remains sub-50; prices remain elevated.

JOLTS JOB OPENINGS (NOV) — 10:00
Consensus: ~7.67mn; openings rate ~4.6%.
Openings trending lower; labor market differential at cycle lows;
watch revisions to earlier months.

FACTORY ORDERS (OCT) — 10:00
Consensus: ~-1.1% m/m.
Headline softness led by defense/aircraft; core capital goods orders
and shipments remain firm (+~0.5% / +~0.7%).


THURSDAY 08 JAN — LIVE (PREVIEW)
--------------------------------------------------

CHALLENGER JOB CUTS (DEC) — 07:30
Announced cuts elevated through November; useful read-through
on layoff trends.

NONFARM PRODUCTIVITY (3Q PRELIM) — 08:30
Consensus: ~+4.7% q/q saar.
Very strong quarter aligned with robust 3Q GDP; volatility high
but trend productivity improving.

UNIT LABOR COSTS (3Q PRELIM) — 08:30
Consensus: ~+0.5% q/q saar.
Easing cost pressure consistent with productivity surge and
wage moderation.

Analysis: major forecasters cluster near ~70–75k and ~4.6%
unemployment rate with risk to 4.5%; hours likely 34.2–34.3;
watch revision patterns, sector mix (education/health firm;
leisure/hospitality softer), and wage moderation.

HOUSING STARTS & BUILDING PERMITS

<<LIVE_USD_MACRO_END>>


<<<USD_MACRO_NOTE_BEGIN>>>
Date: 2 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Window: last 4 weeks into year-end 2025 (with regime anchors explicitly labelled)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (binding constraint): U.S. is in a growth-floor / labour-cooling regime. The binding constraint for policy is the labour slack trajectory versus core/services inflation persistence, not the level of headline activity.

What changed in this window (delta):

Policy: Fed delivered a 25bp cut in Dec 2025 and framed it as “insurance” largely completed → pause is baseline unless labour/inflation deteriorate.

Liquidity implementation: reserve-management bill purchases (~$40bn first month / near term elevated) were announced as technical plumbing → reduces money-market tail risk but not a macro easing signal by itself.

Data quality / noise: shutdown-related distortions + revisions are a first-order issue for signal extraction.

What did not change:

Activity prints can look strong (GDP tracking / consumption), but labour is still cooling at the margin.

Inflation constraint is still core/services momentum, not headline.

Regime-change triggers:

Dovish acceleration: unemployment drifts above ~4.7% (user narrative) with corroboration (hours/wages/continuing claims trend).

Hawkish tail / pause-longer: core/services persistence reasserts; cuts get deferred.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Union-mode: ALL user-provided releases included; verification shown only via numbers that can be confirmed; otherwise “n/a (not verified)” or “(User input)” retained.)

Dec 2025 – Fed policy action + liquidity operations
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 25bp cut (User input) / n/a / prior n/a
Signal: Cut framed as “insurance” easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation (User input).
HF take: Reaction function shifts to near-neutral plateau + conditionality; market should not extrapolate a mechanical easing cycle.
Add-on (implementation): Reserve management purchases ~“$40bn first month / near term elevated” (User input).
HF take: Technical support to keep reserves ample; reduces funding-tail risk, but is not QE-by-intent.

Late 2025 – Real activity / GDP tracking
3Q GDP: ~3.5% q/q saar (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Upside risks to near-term growth tracking (User input); composition flagged as trade/inventories (User input).
HF take: Growth floor can coexist with labour cooling; quality/composition matters more than headline.

Nov 2025 – CPI (User input summary)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: Headline ~+0.3% m/m (User input); Core ~+0.27–0.30% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Mixed inflation signals; shutdown-related distortions and rebound risk (User input).
HF take: The Fed’s pause is consistent with inflation noise: it wants confirmation on core/services momentum before moving again.

Labour – unemployment / openings / quits / claims (composite)
Unemployment: ~4.6% in late 2025 (User input); peak read ~4.7% early 2026 (User narrative) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Cooling but not collapsing (User input).
HF take: This supports “pause” unless corroborated by hours/wage cooling or a sustained rise in continuing claims.

Initial claims: ~220k week ending Dec 13 (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Elevated vs cyclical troughs (~200–220k) (User input).
HF take: Claims are above trough but still consistent with low layoffs; labour cooling is more about hiring.

Nov 2025 — Pending Home Sales
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +3.3% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Strong gain, highest since Feb 2023 (User input).
HF take: Housing is stabilising off depressed levels; contributes to the “growth floor,” but does not negate labour cooling.

(Additional user-provided level): Pending home sales ~77.5 (mn ar) (User input)
HF note: Level metric is kept as provided; treated as non-core because definition/units vary.

Nov 2025 — Average weekly workweek
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 34.3 hours (Nov) (User input); expected 34.2 (Dec) (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Hours stable over ~18 months (User input).
HF take: Hours are a high-signal labour margin; stability argues against abrupt recession, but a downshift would be an early dovish trigger.

Late 2025 — Payroll prints and revisions
Actual / Consensus / Prior: “first-round revisions tended negative” (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Revision risk can materially change initial payroll reads (User input).
HF take: Under a pause regime, tighten the filter: do not overweight first prints if revision/collection noise is elevated.

Dec 2025 – PMIs (S&P Global; user summary)
All-industry output: 53.0 (User input); prior 54.2 (User input)
Services business activity: 52.9 (User input)
New business: 54.3 (User input)
Services prices: “cycle highs” (User input)
Manufacturing composite: 51.8 (User input)
Signal: Growth slowed but remains expansionary; prices pressures concentrated in services (User input).
HF take: Consistent with growth floor + services inflation constraint → reinforces “pause.”

Nov 2025 – Retail sales
Control group: +0.5% m/m (User input)
Headline: ~−0.1% m/m (User input) (autos timing)
Signal: Underlying consumption resilient despite headline dip.
HF take: Supports near-term activity; makes labour the main pivot for further cuts.

Dec 2025 – Philadelphia Fed
General conditions: “positive; components mixed” (User input)
Signal: Regional activity steady but uneven.
HF take: Secondary sentinel: supportive, not decisive versus labour/inflation constraint.

Top-Down Macro

Hierarchy (HF compression):

Policy reaction function is the regime anchor: cut-to-near-neutral then pause unless labour slack accelerates or inflation persistence breaks the other way.

Labour is the binding constraint: unemployment drifting higher + openings/quits moderating; watch hours and continuing claims for confirmation.

Inflation remains noisy: services prices / core momentum are the key; shutdown/revision noise raises the threshold for reacting to any single print.

Activity is a floor, not a green light: retail/control + PMI expansion suggest no imminent recession, but composition/revision issues keep conviction capped.

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS “growth floor + labour cooling,” with convexity in labour drift vs services inflation persistence.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

FOMC (Dec 2025)
Policy decision: 25bp cut (User input); stance framed as near-neutral with high optionality.
Rationale: insurance easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation.
Projections: n/a (not required for this rerun; not verified in user text).

Rolling communications (include-boilerplate ON; discipline > omission)

Powell (Chair) – Dec 2025 (press conference)
Core message: pause baseline; data-dependent; separated liquidity ops from stance.
Bias: neutral-to-cautious.
Adds/changes: institutionalises pause and raises the bar for sequential cuts.

FOMC Minutes – Dec 2025
Core message: finely balanced; uncertainty elevated; implementation/reserves discussed.
Bias: neutral (distribution-aware).
Adds/changes: strengthens “pause can persist” even after a cut.

(Other speakers in rolling month)

Included only if dated, policy-relevant and verified; otherwise excluded to avoid false precision.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

In-window: No verified market-moving fiscal/political shock in the user input beyond shutdown-related data distortion risk.
Rolling: data-quality risk raises uncertainty premia; does not mechanically shift macro baseline.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: front-end anchored by “cut-to-neutral then pause”; sensitivity highest to labour confirmation (hours/claims/UE drift) and services inflation momentum.
USD: supported by growth floor and pause optionality; downside if labour drift forces earlier/steeper cut path.
