USD MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (Jan 5–Jan 9, 2026)
STATUS: Final as of Friday close

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

ISM Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 47.9 vs Cons 48.4 vs Prior 48.2

HF take: Manufacturing remains in contraction and deteriorated modestly at the margin. This continues to signal goods-sector drag, but not a regime break. The policy relevance is second-order unless weakness spills into services demand or labor. Transmission is primarily via earnings cyclicality, capex restraint, and term-premium sensitivity, not the Fed reaction function.

ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual 58.5 vs Cons 57.0 vs Prior 58.5

HF take: Persistent upstream price pressure despite contraction keeps the inflation tail non-negligible. This prevents the market from cleanly extrapolating weak manufacturing into fast easing. Alone, this does not re-anchor policy expectations; it matters only in combination with services inflation metrics.

ISM Manufacturing Employment (Dec)
Actual 44.0 vs Prior 44.9

HF take: Goods-sector labor demand remains weak. This is known and priced, and only matters if corroborated by claims or NFP diffusion.

ISM Manufacturing New Orders (Dec)
Actual 47.4 vs Prior 47.7

HF take: Orders remain sub-50 with no inventory-led rebound signal. Reinforces the view that goods demand is a drag, not a catalyst.

U.S. 6M & 3M Bill Auctions (Jan 5)
HF take: Healthy demand and coverage. No funding stress or liquidity signal relevant for macro.

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 53.0 vs Cons 52.7

HF take: Composite activity remains expansionary, reinforcing the soft-landing base case and offsetting weak ISM manufacturing. Supports patience in policy pricing.

S&P Global Services PMI (Dec, final)
Actual 52.9 vs Cons 52.5

HF take: Services remain in expansion. This confirms that growth momentum is services-led, reducing the probability that goods weakness alone triggers a dovish pivot.

Redbook YoY (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 7.1% vs Prior 7.6%

HF take: Marginal deceleration; noise unless confirmed by hard consumption data.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

ADP National Employment (Dec)
Actual +41k vs Cons ~50k vs Prior revised -29k

HF take: Hiring is positive but subdued, consistent with late-cycle normalization. Composition matters: services gains dominate, goods employment continues to contract. ADP mainly frames expectations into NFP rather than shifting policy probabilities.

Durables / Factory Orders (Oct, revised)

HF take: Headline durables and factory orders confirm capex and goods softness, but ex-transport and non-defense capex show underlying stabilization, not collapse. This caps recession risk but does not generate upside torque.

ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 54.4 vs Cons 52.3 vs Prior 52.6

HF take (dominant weekly signal): Services activity re-accelerated meaningfully, reaching a 13-month high with broad-based strength. This materially raises the confidence threshold for easing and truncates the near-term dovish tail.

Internal signal hierarchy:
• New orders surged to a ~15-month high, rebuilding forward momentum into early 2026.
• Employment rebounded into expansion, directly countering narratives of imminent labor market stress.
• Sequential strength is partially distorted by post-shutdown normalization; professionals therefore prioritize cross-survey confirmation over one-month acceleration.

ISM Services Prices Paid (Dec)
Actual ~64.3 (8-month low)

HF take: Directionally constructive for disinflation, but the level remains consistent with elevated supercore PCE. Inflation pressure is easing at the margin, not normalized. This supports “hold longer” rather than early cuts.

JOLTS Job Openings (Nov)
Actual 7.15m vs Prior 7.67m

HF take: Continued cooling in labor demand supports a rebalancing narrative, but remains secondary relative to strong services activity and low claims.

EIA Weekly Energy Data
HF take: Large crude draw but offset by gasoline and distillate builds. Commodity-micro, not a macro impulse.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

Q3 Productivity (prelim)
Actual +4.9% annualized vs Cons +3.0% vs Prior +4.1%

HF take (critical macro offset): Productivity growth surprised sharply to the upside, lifting the 12-month pace to ~1.9% — well above the pre-COVID norm. Non-financial corporate productivity also strengthened.

This matters because:
• Unit labor costs fell 1.9%, a powerful disinflationary signal for supercore services.
• Productivity gains allow services growth without commensurate wage inflation, materially capping the hawkish tail.
• Professional macro interpretation increasingly views this as structural efficiency gains, plausibly linked to technology/AI adoption rather than cyclical noise.

Policy implication: This print offsets strong ISM services and is the key reason the Fed can remain patient without re-tightening bias.

US International Trade (Oct)
Actual -$29.4bn vs Prior -$48.1bn

HF take: Headline improvement is distorted by volatile categories. Exports were boosted by non-monetary gold (excluded from GDP), while imports fell sharply due to a temporary collapse in pharmaceutical shipments linked to tariff announcements.

Ex-distortions:
• Net trade likely provides a mechanical boost to Q4 GDP, but
• Imports (notably tech-related) appear to be re-accelerating into year-end, consistent with ongoing AI-related investment.

Policy relevance is limited; this is a GDP-tracking input, not a regime signal.

Initial Jobless Claims (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 208k vs Cons 210k

HF take: Claims remain firmly anchored. This is the cleanest real-time labor signal and directly contradicts recessionary narratives.

Continuing Claims
Actual 1.91m

HF take: Gradual drift higher, consistent with rebalancing rather than stress.

Consumer Credit (Nov)
Actual $4.2bn vs Cons $10.0bn

HF take: Sharp downside surprise suggests less reliance on credit-financed consumption. Late-cycle cooling signal, but not contractionary on its own.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

Non-Farm Payrolls (Dec)
Actual +50k vs Cons +70k (revised)

HF take: Payroll growth slowed materially, and prior months were revised down. On a headline basis this is soft, but not recessionary.

Composition matters:
• Services job gains concentrated in leisure/hospitality and healthcare;
• Goods, retail, construction, and professional services contracted;
• Diffusion indices remain just above 50, signaling narrow, uneven hiring.

Unemployment Rate (Dec)
Actual 4.38% vs Prior 4.54%

HF take: The decline reflects higher household employment and partial reversal of shutdown-related distortions. This invalidates a hard-landing labor narrative, even as payroll growth slows.

Underlying job growth estimates suggest hiring near or slightly below breakeven, implying cooling without collapse.

Wages and Hours
AHE +0.33% m/m; 3.76% y/y
Average workweek 34.2

HF take: Wage growth remains resilient, but productivity gains materially offset inflation risk. The Fed will place greater weight on ECI and unit labor costs, which now point to easing pressure by mid-year.

Housing Starts / Permits (Oct)

HF take: Starts weakened, particularly multifamily; permits held up, suggesting flooring rather than renewed downside. Housing remains rate-constrained, with limited macro spillover.

University of Michigan (Jan prelim)

HF take: Sentiment improved modestly; inflation expectations remain contained. No de-anchoring signal.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

The week tightens the soft-landing narrative rather than breaks it.

• Services activity is firm and forward-looking indicators improved.
• Labor markets are cooling but not deteriorating; unemployment fell and claims remain low.
• The decisive offset is productivity: strong efficiency gains and falling unit labor costs materially reduce inflation risk even with solid services demand.

Reaction-function implication:
The Fed is validated in patience. Near-term aggressive easing is harder to justify, but productivity-led disinflation caps the hawkish tail. The policy distribution compresses around “hold longer, cut later”, with March easing possible but no longer assured.

Date: 2 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Window: last 4 weeks into year-end 2025 (with regime anchors explicitly labelled)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (binding constraint): U.S. is in a growth-floor / labour-cooling regime. The binding constraint for policy is the labour slack trajectory versus core/services inflation persistence, not the level of headline activity.

What changed in this window (delta):

Policy: Fed delivered a 25bp cut in Dec 2025 and framed it as “insurance” largely completed → pause is baseline unless labour/inflation deteriorate.

Liquidity implementation: reserve-management bill purchases (~$40bn first month / near term elevated) were announced as technical plumbing → reduces money-market tail risk but not a macro easing signal by itself.

Data quality / noise: shutdown-related distortions + revisions are a first-order issue for signal extraction.

What did not change:

Activity prints can look strong (GDP tracking / consumption), but labour is still cooling at the margin.

Inflation constraint is still core/services momentum, not headline.

Regime-change triggers:

Dovish acceleration: unemployment drifts above ~4.7% (user narrative) with corroboration (hours/wages/continuing claims trend).

Hawkish tail / pause-longer: core/services persistence reasserts; cuts get deferred.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Union-mode: ALL user-provided releases included; verification shown only via numbers that can be confirmed; otherwise “n/a (not verified)” or “(User input)” retained.)

Dec 2025 – Fed policy action + liquidity operations
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 25bp cut (User input) / n/a / prior n/a
Signal: Cut framed as “insurance” easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation (User input).
HF take: Reaction function shifts to near-neutral plateau + conditionality; market should not extrapolate a mechanical easing cycle.
Add-on (implementation): Reserve management purchases ~“$40bn first month / near term elevated” (User input).
HF take: Technical support to keep reserves ample; reduces funding-tail risk, but is not QE-by-intent.

Late 2025 – Real activity / GDP tracking
3Q GDP: ~3.5% q/q saar (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Upside risks to near-term growth tracking (User input); composition flagged as trade/inventories (User input).
HF take: Growth floor can coexist with labour cooling; quality/composition matters more than headline.

Nov 2025 – CPI (User input summary)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: Headline ~+0.3% m/m (User input); Core ~+0.27–0.30% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Mixed inflation signals; shutdown-related distortions and rebound risk (User input).
HF take: The Fed’s pause is consistent with inflation noise: it wants confirmation on core/services momentum before moving again.

Labour – unemployment / openings / quits / claims (composite)
Unemployment: ~4.6% in late 2025 (User input); peak read ~4.7% early 2026 (User narrative) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Cooling but not collapsing (User input).
HF take: This supports “pause” unless corroborated by hours/wage cooling or a sustained rise in continuing claims.

Initial claims: ~220k week ending Dec 13 (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Elevated vs cyclical troughs (~200–220k) (User input).
HF take: Claims are above trough but still consistent with low layoffs; labour cooling is more about hiring.

Nov 2025 — Pending Home Sales
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +3.3% m/m (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Strong gain, highest since Feb 2023 (User input).
HF take: Housing is stabilising off depressed levels; contributes to the “growth floor,” but does not negate labour cooling.

(Additional user-provided level): Pending home sales ~77.5 (mn ar) (User input)
HF note: Level metric is kept as provided; treated as non-core because definition/units vary.

Nov 2025 — Average weekly workweek
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 34.3 hours (Nov) (User input); expected 34.2 (Dec) (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Hours stable over ~18 months (User input).
HF take: Hours are a high-signal labour margin; stability argues against abrupt recession, but a downshift would be an early dovish trigger.

Late 2025 — Payroll prints and revisions
Actual / Consensus / Prior: “first-round revisions tended negative” (User input) / n/a / n/a
Signal: Revision risk can materially change initial payroll reads (User input).
HF take: Under a pause regime, tighten the filter: do not overweight first prints if revision/collection noise is elevated.

Dec 2025 – PMIs (S&P Global; user summary)
All-industry output: 53.0 (User input); prior 54.2 (User input)
Services business activity: 52.9 (User input)
New business: 54.3 (User input)
Services prices: “cycle highs” (User input)
Manufacturing composite: 51.8 (User input)
Signal: Growth slowed but remains expansionary; prices pressures concentrated in services (User input).
HF take: Consistent with growth floor + services inflation constraint → reinforces “pause.”

Nov 2025 – Retail sales
Control group: +0.5% m/m (User input)
Headline: ~−0.1% m/m (User input) (autos timing)
Signal: Underlying consumption resilient despite headline dip.
HF take: Supports near-term activity; makes labour the main pivot for further cuts.

Dec 2025 – Philadelphia Fed
General conditions: “positive; components mixed” (User input)
Signal: Regional activity steady but uneven.
HF take: Secondary sentinel: supportive, not decisive versus labour/inflation constraint.

Top-Down Macro

Hierarchy (HF compression):

Policy reaction function is the regime anchor: cut-to-near-neutral then pause unless labour slack accelerates or inflation persistence breaks the other way.

Labour is the binding constraint: unemployment drifting higher + openings/quits moderating; watch hours and continuing claims for confirmation.

Inflation remains noisy: services prices / core momentum are the key; shutdown/revision noise raises the threshold for reacting to any single print.

Activity is a floor, not a green light: retail/control + PMI expansion suggest no imminent recession, but composition/revision issues keep conviction capped.

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS “growth floor + labour cooling,” with convexity in labour drift vs services inflation persistence.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

FOMC (Dec 2025)
Policy decision: 25bp cut (User input); stance framed as near-neutral with high optionality.
Rationale: insurance easing; pause conditional on labour/inflation.
Projections: n/a (not required for this rerun; not verified in user text).

Rolling communications (include-boilerplate ON; discipline > omission)

Powell (Chair) – Dec 2025 (press conference)
Core message: pause baseline; data-dependent; separated liquidity ops from stance.
Bias: neutral-to-cautious.
Adds/changes: institutionalises pause and raises the bar for sequential cuts.

FOMC Minutes – Dec 2025
Core message: finely balanced; uncertainty elevated; implementation/reserves discussed.
Bias: neutral (distribution-aware).
Adds/changes: strengthens “pause can persist” even after a cut.

Included only if dated, policy-relevant and verified; otherwise excluded to avoid false precision.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

In-window: No verified market-moving fiscal/political shock in the user input beyond shutdown-related data distortion risk.
Rolling: data-quality risk raises uncertainty premia; does not mechanically shift macro baseline.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: front-end anchored by “cut-to-neutral then pause”; sensitivity highest to labour confirmation (hours/claims/UE drift) and services inflation momentum.
USD: supported by growth floor and pause optionality; downside if labour drift forces earlier/steeper cut path.
