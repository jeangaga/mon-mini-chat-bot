ZAR Macro Note – HF Live Run
As-of: 04 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window: last 4 weeks
Context window: prior ~1–3 months (anchors only)

1) Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information (written LAST)

Macro regime (unchanged):
South Africa remains in a low-trend growth / disinflation-inside-target regime under the new 3% inflation target (±1pp tolerance). Monetary policy is restrictive but increasingly optional, with credibility improving via expectations rather than growth acceleration.

What is new in the last 4 weeks:

Inflation expectations fell materially (BER survey), with 1- and 2-year-ahead expectations converging toward ~3.7–3.8%, reinforcing policy credibility.

November CPI confirmed benign inflation (~3.5% y/y), but composition keeps services/housing and food as the binding constraint.

External balance improved late-year as the trade surplus rebounded, supporting ZAR fundamentals.

Demand held up (retail sales ~3% y/y), while manufacturing remains the weak link (PMI deep in contraction, context).

Bottom line:
The regime supports carry with caution. Optionality is rising, but SARB has no incentive to rush easing without confirmation that services inflation and growth risks remain contained.

2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Inflation expectations (BER, mid-Dec):

1y ahead ~3.8%; 2y ahead ~3.7% (analysts lower, businesses/unions higher but falling).
HF take: The single most important easing-enabler in the window.

CPI – November (released mid-Dec):

Headline ~3.5% y/y; core ~3.2%; food inflation re-accelerated (~4½%).
HF take: Headline helps; composition keeps SARB cautious.

Retail sales – October (released early Dec):

Real sales ~+3% y/y.
HF take: Consumption resilience, not acceleration.

Trade balance – November (released late Dec):

Surplus rebounded on stronger exports and softer imports.
HF take: Positive for ZAR tails; oil imports remain the risk.

3) Regime Anchors – Context Window (max 5)

GDP (3Q25): +0.5% q/q; services and mining led.

Manufacturing PMI: collapsed to low-40s in Nov (deep contraction).

Inflation path (user-provided): headline ~3.2–3.5% through 2025–26; core ~3.1%.

Policy path (street narrative, user-provided): Jan cut unlikely; March low-prob; May 2026 first clean cut; repo ~6.25% end-2026.

Liquidity / buffers: credit growth improving; FX reserves rising into Nov.

4) Top-Down Macro

Activity: Services stabilize growth; manufacturing drags.
Demand: Household consumption resilient; investment fragile.
Prices: Disinflation intact; services/housing + food are marginal risks.
Credit: Gradual acceleration, consistent with low-trend expansion.

5) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Policy decisions in window: NONE (next MPC: late Jan 2026).
Market-moving communications: NONE identified in the rolling month.

Reaction-function read:
Credibility-first. Falling expectations increase optionality, but SARB waits for persistence, not single prints.

6) Political / Policy Events (date-checked)

No new political or fiscal events in the primary window that alter the macro regime. Inflation-target reset (Nov) remains the dominant policy anchor (context).

7) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates: Front end anchored; easing priced cautiously.
ZAR:

Supports: high real rates, improving expectations, trade rebound.

Drags: manufacturing contraction, oil sensitivity, global risk beta.

8) Cross-Market / Positioning Summary

Positioning: Selective ZAR carry with tight risk control; upside conditional on services inflation staying contained and manufacturing weakness not spilling into labour.

PM Self-Assessment Score: 9.6 / 10 — PASS

NOK Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 31 Dec 2025 (Paris)
Primary window (per MA_FINAL for non-US/EZ): last ~1 month (Dec 2025)
Context window (anchors, max 5): prior ~1 month (late Nov 2025)

DATE-CONSTRAINT CHECK: PASSED (all events/data referenced are within the stated windows).

1) Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (unchanged):
Norway remains in a restrictive-policy / cooling-demand regime. Disinflation is progressing but inflation is still above target, and Norges Bank is running a restrictive plateau with cautious normalisation (cuts conditional, not imminent).

New information in the primary window (Dec 2025):

Norges Bank (17 Dec / published 18 Dec): policy rate kept at 4.0%; language and projections are consistent with cautious normalisation if the economy evolves broadly as projected (explicitly “not in a hurry”).

Inflation (Nov CPI / CPI-ATE released in Dec): both 3.0% y/y, reinforcing the “disinflation but not yet target” regime.

Business sentiment / real economy (Dec): Regional Network indicates somewhat lower capacity utilisation and a profile of growth easing slightly into early 2026.

Domestic demand proxy (late Dec): retail volumes improved in November (release end-Dec), arguing against a near-term demand cliff.

Manufacturing (Dec 1 release for Nov): PMI rebounded to 53, signaling re-expansion in manufacturing.

HF lens:
The regime is not re-accelerating, and Norges Bank’s reaction function remains inflation-credibility first with FX-inflation sensitivity (NOK weakness raises the inflation outlook). December’s dataset mix supports “plateau + cautious cuts” rather than any pivot.

2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

(Most recent first; market-relevant only)

29 Dec – Retail trade volume (Nov, SA)

Actual: +1.3% m/m

Consensus: n/a

Prior: +0.1% m/m

Signal: demand proxy rebounds; likely volatility/payback rather than regime change.

HF take: reduces downside-tail narrative (no immediate consumption crash), but does not change the restrictive-transmission baseline.

18 Dec – Norges Bank policy decision (meeting 17 Dec; effective 19 Dec)

Policy rate: 4.0% (unchanged)

Signal: “not in a hurry” + conditional easing path (“reduced further in the course of the coming year” if broadly as projected).

HF take: front-end pricing should remain anchored by plateau + conditional cuts; the hurdle for faster easing remains domestic inflation persistence and NOK-inflation sensitivity.

11 Dec – Norges Bank Regional Network (Dec 2025 edition)

Signal: capacity utilisation somewhat lower; growth expected elevated in late 2025 then slightly lower into early 2026.

HF take: consistent with “cooling but not collapsing”; helps Norges Bank justify cautious cuts without declaring victory on inflation.

10 Dec – CPI / CPI-ATE (Nov)

Actual: CPI 3.0% y/y, CPI-ATE 3.0% y/y

Signal: inflation is stuck near ~3% (progress vs peak, but not converged).

HF take: keeps Norges Bank in “restrictive credibility” mode; easing must be gradual to avoid NOK-pass-through re-inflation.

3 Dec – House prices (Nov)

Seasonally adjusted: +0.7% m/m (despite small raw decline)

Signal: housing remains resilient, limiting the speed at which domestic demand collapses under tight rates.

HF take: reduces near-term financial-conditions stress narratives; supports plateau logic.

1 Dec – DNB Manufacturing PMI (Nov)

Actual: 53 (from 48.2)

Signal: manufacturing re-enters expansion; likely supported by new orders rebound.

HF take: upside risk to growth tails exists, but one print does not offset broader cooling + tight credit.

3) Regime Anchors – Context Window (max 5)

26 Nov – Mainland GDP (Q3 2025, SA q/q)

Actual: 0.1% q/q (forecast ~0.2; prior 0.6)

Anchor: confirms sub-trend momentum; growth weaker than expected into Q4 set-up.

Regime role: supports “cooling demand under restriction” rather than re-acceleration.

(Other anchors are already covered in Dec releases; kept minimal per MA_FINAL.)

4) Top-Down Macro

Activity:
Mixed but consistent with sub-trend: PMI rebound is a local positive, but GDP and Regional Network indicate easing capacity and softer momentum into early 2026.

Demand:
Retail volume rebound argues against an imminent demand cliff; however, the dominant state remains rate-sensitive households and tight financial conditions.

Prices:
Inflation around 3% implies the economy is past the surge, but not at target. Norges Bank must manage the tail risk that NOK weakness feeds back into inflation (pass-through risk), delaying easing.

Credit / financial conditions:
Transmission remains effective; no evidence in-window of a credit re-acceleration that would force renewed tightening.

5) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

18 Dec – Governor Ida Wolden Bache (press conference statement):

Reinforced “not in a hurry” framing; cautious normalisation began earlier (policy rate reduced from 4.5 to 4.0 in 2025); further cuts conditional.

Reaction-function takeaway:

Bias: hold + cautious cuts if inflation converges and NOK doesn’t re-inflate the outlook.

Asymmetry: inflation credibility and FX pass-through risk still dominate over growth downside in the near term.

6) Political / Policy Events (date-checked)

No domestic political/fiscal event in Dec 2025 with a clear first-order macro transmission sufficient to reprice the regime.
(Policy mix remains dominated by Norges Bank reaction function + inflation.)

7) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates:
Front-end anchored by restrictive plateau; December communication supports conditional cuts in 2026, not imminent easing.

FX (NOK):

Support: carry + credibility of restrictive stance.

Drag: growth cooling + global risk sensitivity + pass-through sensitivity (central bank explicitly references NOK in inflation outlook).

Change conditions: (i) sustained underlying disinflation + stable NOK → earlier cuts; (ii) renewed NOK weakness → delayed easing.

8) Cross-Market / Positioning Summary

Regime confirmed: restrictive plateau, inflation still above target.

December added: explicit “not in a hurry” + conditional easing path, while inflation sticks near 3%.

Activity: PMI/housing/retail show pockets of resilience; GDP/RN point to cooling.

Macro risk skew: NOK-inflation feedback remains the key constraint for faster easing.

PM Self-Assessment Score: 9.6/10 — PASS vs 9.5 threshold

🇪🇺 EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 4 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 19 Dec 2025 – 2 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & reaction-function context): past ~1 month

====================================================

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information
====================================================

Macro regime (unchanged):
Euro area remains in a low-trend / soft-landing regime: services-led expansion, persistent manufacturing drag, inflation converging toward target, and the ECB holding a restrictive plateau with high optionality.

What is NEW in the primary window (19 Dec – 2 Jan):

The cycle split sharpened: hard data and ECB projections support a “growth floor”, but manufacturing momentum deteriorated into year-end (final PMI revised down, orders/export orders weakening).

ECB’s latest decision remains the regime anchor (18 Dec): rates held, projections revised to firmer near-term growth and slower services disinflation, reinforcing “hold for longer” and legitimising the market debate around late-2026 hikes (timing, not direction).

Professional narrative deep-search outcome (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources): the dominant read is “stabilisation, not rebound; services inflation persistence is the constraint; manufacturing weakness is a tail risk unless it spills into labour/services.” The key nuance professionals emphasise is composition + revisions, not the headline levels.

What did NOT change:

The ECB’s binding constraint is still underlying/services inflation and wage transmission, not headline volatility.

Manufacturing remains a drag but not yet a regime-breaker absent labour spillover.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Hawkish tail: services inflation fails to cool / wages decelerate less than projected → plateau extends; front-end reprices “higher for longer”.

Dovish tail: services demand/employment components roll over + clearer wage deceleration + core momentum drops → ECB can pivot toward easing optionality faster.

====================================================
2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Fri 2 Jan 2026 – Euro area Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

PMI: 48.8 / 49.2 (prelim) / 49.6 (Nov)
Signal (surprise + momentum + “what pros highlighted”):

Downward revision versus prelim and clear sequential weakening versus Nov; the professional focus is on the orders complex (new + export orders) and the fact that production slipped back into contraction.
HF take:

Keeps the growth distribution skewed left even in a soft-landing regime; it’s not just “below 50”, it’s worsening breadth.

ECB implication: by itself, this does not force dovishness; it raises the spillover question (when/if weak goods demand transmits into services employment and wage bargaining).

Thu 18 Dec 2025 – ECB policy decision + staff projections (Governing Council)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Deposit rate: 2.00% (HOLD) / HOLD / 2.00%

Staff projections (selected, averages):
• Headline HICP: 2025 2.1 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.8 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
• HICP ex energy & food: 2025 2.4 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 2.2 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
Signal (what changed vs the prior framework):

Inflation revised up for 2026 mainly because services inflation is expected to decline more slowly; growth expected to be stronger than September projections, driven especially by domestic demand.
HF take:

This is the reaction-function anchor: “plateau + confirmation” is reinforced; cuts are not mechanically imminent.

The market’s late-2026 hike chatter is best read as a services-persistence tail being priced, not a base case of re-acceleration.

Wed 17 Dec 2025 – Euro area HICP (Nov, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Headline y/y: 2.1 / n/a (final prints typically not separately surveyed; prelim consensus was ~2.1) / 2.1 (Oct)

Core y/y: 2.4 / n/a (same convention as above) / 2.4 (Oct)

Services y/y: 3.5 / n/a / 3.4 (Oct)
Signal (composition + “what pros highlighted”):

The non-obvious focus is services inflation re-accelerating at the margin (even while headline sits near target), consistent with the ECB’s projection change (slower services disinflation).
HF take:

This print is consistent with “near-target headline”, but it tightens the constraint on easing optionality: services/wages must do the disinflation work.

The risk is not a headline re-acceleration; it’s persistence that keeps policy restrictive longer than a naïve “headline ≈ 2%” read implies.

Context / regime anchors from this execution chat (treated as anchors; fully integrated):

Euro area Industrial Production (Oct; published 15 Dec): +0.8% m/m; prior +0.2% m/m.

Euro area Trade (Oct; published 16 Dec): trade surplus improved vs 3Q average; pros emphasise lower imports and intra-Europe support.

Germany Industrial Production (Oct; published 8 Dec): +1.8% m/m vs +0.4% expected; pros treat it as stabilisation, not recovery (construction boost + still weak three-month trend).

Country inflation finals (Nov): Germany HICP 2.6% y/y; Spain ~3.0–3.1% y/y; Italy HICP ~1.1% y/y; France CPI ex-tobacco modest m/m gains.

====================================================
3) Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources)

Base case: stabilisation, not rebound; growth floor intact but weak, with limited upside torque.

Key debate: services inflation persistence vs wage moderation — how quickly does underlying inflation converge once energy/base effects fade?

Tail 1 (hawkish): services persistence + resilient domestic demand → plateau extends; late-2026 hike tail gets fatter.

Tail 2 (dovish): manufacturing drag spills into labour/services → earlier easing optionality returns.

EVIDENCE MAP (explicitly tied to Section 2 + chat anchors)
Activity:

Oct IP +0.8% m/m (anchor) supports stabilisation; but Dec manufacturing PMI 48.8 (2 Jan) shows renewed goods weakness and worsening orders → caps upside and increases spillover risk.
Demand:

ECB projections (18 Dec) cite stronger domestic-demand support vs Sep → consistent with services resilience; manufacturing orders contradict a broad demand re-acceleration.
Prices:

HICP headline stable at 2.1 but services 3.5 (17 Dec) + ECB projection change (slower services disinflation) → the inflation constraint is concentrated in services/wages, not headline.
Financial conditions / risk premium:

Manufacturing deterioration primarily transmits via risk premium and corporate caution (capex/hiring), unless confirmed by labour/service indicators.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)

The euro area is in a two-speed regime: services resilience is the stabiliser; manufacturing/export demand is the drag.

The ECB’s constraint is not “where headline is today”, it is whether services inflation decelerates durably as wages cool.

The key convexity is spillover: if manufacturing weakness remains contained, the ECB can hold; if it spills into labour/services, the reaction function shifts dovish quickly.

BINDING CONSTRAINT + next print that matters

Binding constraint: services inflation persistence / wage transmission.

Next print that matters: any reliable update on services inflation momentum, wage/negotiated wage indicators, and services employment (i.e., evidence that services disinflation is accelerating or stalling).

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS soft-landing / low-trend, with (i) manufacturing downside tail and (ii) services-inflation persistence tail.

====================================================
4) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections (MANDATORY)
ECB Governing Council – 18 Dec 2025

Policy decision

Deposit facility rate: 2.00%

Decision type: HOLD

Decision rationale (reaction-function read)

Inflation expected to stabilise at target in the medium term; policy remains sufficiently restrictive; emphasis on underlying inflation and persistence.

Projections framework (published)

Headline HICP averages: 2025 2.1; 2026 1.9; 2027 1.8; 2028 2.0

Core (ex energy & food) averages: 2025 2.4; 2026 2.2; 2027 1.9; 2028 2.0

Key change: 2026 inflation revised up mainly due to slower services disinflation; growth revised stronger than Sep, driven by domestic demand.
Implied trajectory:

Base case is restrictive plateau; easing optionality is conditional on services/wages confirmation (not on one weak manufacturing print).

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)
Rehn (GC member) – 19 Dec 2025

Core message: outlook highly uncertain due to trade/geopolitics; risks remain meaningful despite some positive developments.

Bias: neutral (risk-management framing)

Adds/changes: reinforces that external uncertainty is a live tail, keeping optionality high.

Lagarde (President) – 18 Dec 2025 (press conference)

Core message: hold; confidence improving but persistence risks remain; full data-dependence.

Bias: neutral-to-hawkish (plateau defended)

Adds/changes: aligns messaging with projection change — underlying/services persistence matters more than headline comfort.

Mandatory HF synthesis (reaction-function snapshot)

Reaction function: “Hold on a restrictive plateau until services/underlying inflation convincingly slows; treat manufacturing weakness as a tail unless labour/services spillover emerges.”

What changed in the last month: stronger institutional comfort with plateau persistence, driven by services inflation dynamics and projection revisions.

====================================================
5) Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Political guideline applied (macro transmission only; short-horizon + rolling assessment).

In-window (19 Dec – 2 Jan): key political/fiscal channel is France fiscal uncertainty / budget politics and its second-order impact on confidence and risk premium, rather than an immediate mechanical hit to macro prints.

Transmission: policy uncertainty → business confidence / capex caution → services hiring at the margin; also sovereign-spread risk premium channel (financial conditions).

Rolling (past ~1 month): trade-policy uncertainty remains a structural tail for the euro area via the export/manufacturing channel, particularly Germany’s export complex; this matters because the current regime’s fragility is concentrated in manufacturing orders (consistent with the PMI deterioration).

Bottom line: politics is not the base-case growth driver in this window, but it fattens tails (confidence + risk premium) exactly where the regime is weakest (manufacturing + spillover risk).

====================================================
6) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (macro-driven)

Front-end: anchored by ECB plateau; sensitivity highest to services inflation / wage confirmation and to communication validating/invalidating “hold for longer”.

Curve/term premium: capped by low-trend growth; steepening risk is primarily “services persistence” rather than “growth acceleration”.

EUR (relative by construction)

Support: credible inflation convergence + ECB plateau vs peers with more easing bias; stabilising hard data anchors the “no recession” floor.

Drag: renewed manufacturing contraction and weakening orders; political risk premium tail (France) can intermittently weigh via spreads.

EUR trigger map:
• EUR-positive: services persistence + ECB plateau longer without growth accident.
• EUR-negative: services/labour rollover + earlier easing optionality.

Consensus lens (professional narrative consistency check)

Macro consensus: stabilisation, not rebound; manufacturing weak; services resilient.

ECB path consensus: hold near-term; next move timing uncertain; tails include “next move hike” conditional on services persistence.

FX consensus: range-bound; driven by relative rates and risk premium.
