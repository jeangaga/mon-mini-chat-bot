CHINA LIVE MACRO NOTE — HF RUN
Date: February 9, 2026
Primary window: February 2–9, 2026
Rolling perspective: 4 weeks (Jan 12 – Feb 9, 2026)
Mode: LIVE (HF sensitivity)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REGIME

Domestic demand collapse is now CONFIRMED.  
Export sector still holds.  
PBoC boxed into TARGETED STIMULUS mode — not a bazooka.

This is NOT a generic “China slowdown.”  
It is a **BIFURCATED ECONOMY**:

• State / domestic demand: contracting  
• Private / export sector: resilient  
• Production: holding  
• Consumption + investment: failing  

The critical diagnostic signal is the **NBS–Caixin divergence**:
→ NBS Manufacturing PMI 49.3 (state, domestic firms)
→ Caixin Manufacturing PMI 50.3 (private, export firms)

China’s binding problem is **DOMESTIC DEMAND AND CONFIDENCE**, not external demand.

FX is **NOT the binding constraint at this stage** (CNH remains stable), which allows
PBoC to ease — but only in a **controlled, targeted** manner.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT CHANGED (ROLLING 4 WEEKS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1) DOMESTIC DEMAND COLLAPSE — CONFIRMED, NOT ANECDOTAL

• NBS PMI: 50.1 (Dec) → 49.3 (Jan)
• New orders: 49.2 (deep contraction)
• Consumer goods PMI: 48.3
• Fixed asset investment: -3.8% YTD (miss vs -3.0% consensus)
• Retail sales: 0.9% y/y (miss, down from 1.3%)

This is now a **coherent demand-side failure**, not monthly noise.

2) PRODUCTION VS DEMAND GAP WIDENING

• Industrial output: 5.2% (beat, accelerating)
• Production sub-index: 50.6 (expansion)
• New orders: 49.2 (contraction)

Classic **destocking / inventory mismatch**:
firms are producing (exports, inventories), but demand is not absorbing output.

3) STATE / PRIVATE DIVERGENCE — DOMINANT SIGNAL

• NBS PMI (SOEs / domestic): 49.3
• Caixin PMI (SMEs / exporters): 50.3
• High-tech manufacturing: 52.0 (second month >52)

This confirms:
→ Export-facing private sector survives  
→ Domestic-facing state sector fails  

Policy implication: **credit-to-SOEs is ineffective**; support must hit households/SMEs.

4) DEFLATION PRESSURE EASING — MARGINALLY, NOT REGIME-CHANGING

• PPI: -1.9% (from -2.2%)
• CPI: 0.8%
• Ex-factory prices PMI: 50.6 (first >50 in ~20 months)

This is **not demand reflation**.
It is cost/base-effect relief + FX pass-through + inventory pricing.

5) CREDIT IMPULSE POSITIVE — BUT NOT TRANSMITTING

• TSF: 2,210bn (beat)
• New yuan loans: 910bn (beat)
• M2: 8.5%

Yet:
• Investment still -3.8%
• Retail still 0.9%

This confirms the core problem:
**willingness to spend / invest is broken**, not liquidity supply.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT DID NOT CHANGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Export resilience (+6.6% y/y)
• Structural property drag
• Low inflation (no policy constraint)
• Policy preference for targeted tools, not blanket stimulus
• FX stability remains a policy priority

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2) KEY MACRO RELEASES — SELECTED (4-WEEK WINDOW)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK OF FEB 2–9

CHINA — CAIXIN MANUFACTURING PMI (JAN)
50.3 vs 50.1 prior  
(NBS PMI: 49.3)

HF TAKE:
This divergence is the **single most important signal** of the period.
Private/export firms expanding while state/domestic firms contract confirms
domestic demand failure — not an export shock.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK OF JAN 26–31

CHINA — NBS MANUFACTURING PMI (JAN)
49.3 vs 50.0 consensus, 50.1 prior

Key sub-indices:
• Production: 50.6
• New orders: 49.2
• Consumer goods: 48.3
• High-tech manufacturing: 52.0

HF TAKE:
Back into contraction after one-month blip.
This validates that December strength was noise.
Demand is the problem, not capacity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK OF JAN 19–23

CHINA — FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT (DEC)
-3.8% y/y vs -3.0% consensus

HF TAKE:
Private capex inertia persists.
No sign of endogenous recovery.
Fiscal execution, not monetary easing, is required.

CHINA — RETAIL SALES (DEC)
0.9% y/y vs 1.2% consensus

HF TAKE:
Household demand remains the weakest link.
Confirms “confidence / savings trap.”

CHINA — INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT (DEC)
5.2% y/y vs 5.0% consensus

HF TAKE:
Supply holds via exports/inventory.
Does NOT contradict domestic demand failure.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK OF JAN 12–16

CHINA — EXPORTS (DEC)
+6.6% y/y vs +3.0% consensus

HF TAKE:
External demand resilience is carrying growth optics.
This delays panic stimulus but increases surplus-politics risk.

CHINA — TSF / LOANS / M2 (DEC)
All beat expectations.

HF TAKE:
Credit impulse positive, but transmission broken.
Monetary policy alone cannot fix demand.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3) TOP-DOWN MACRO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DOMINANT FORCE

**Domestic demand collapse meets export resilience.**

This is a structural bifurcation:
• Production > demand
• Exports > consumption
• Credit supply > credit usage

ACTIVITY

Manufacturing:
• NBS PMI <50, Caixin >50
• Destocking pattern confirmed
• High-tech/export sectors resilient

Services:
• Holding >50, not accelerating
• No collapse yet — but vulnerable if labor weakens

DEMAND

Consumption:
• Retail <1%
• Confidence broken (property wealth destruction, income uncertainty)

Investment:
• Fixed asset investment deeply negative
• Private sector unwilling to deploy capital

PRICES

• CPI lowflation → no constraint
• PPI less negative → marginal relief
• Not demand-led inflation

CREDIT

• Liquidity ample
• Transmission broken
• Fiscal, not monetary, is the missing link

BINDING CONSTRAINT

Household and private-sector confidence.
This cannot be solved with RRR cuts alone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4) PBoC REACTION FUNCTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CURRENT STANCE

• Targeted easing
• Avoid property reflation
• Preserve FX stability
• Lean on fiscal channel

EXPECTED Q1 ACTIONS

Monetary:
• RRR cut (~50bp), targeted
• Modest MLF/LPR adjustment (signalling, not panic)

Fiscal (March NPC critical):
• Deficit target likely 4.0–4.5% GDP
• Consumption vouchers / transfers
• Local government debt refinancing
• Strategic sector support

NO:
• Infrastructure bazooka
• Property reflation cycle

TRIGGERS FOR AGGRESSIVE EASING

• PMI <48 for multiple months
• Sharp IP slowdown
• Labor market deterioration
• External shock (tariffs)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5) POLITICAL / POLICY CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

No short-term political shocks.
All focus on **March NPC**.

Key watchpoints:
• Fiscal deficit size
• Consumption support scale
• Property stabilization language
• Growth target signalling (5.0 vs 4.5)

Policy regime is **managed slowdown**, not crisis response.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6) CROSS-MARKET (MACRO LOGIC ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FX (CNH)

CNH stability indicates:
• External balance still anchors FX
• Capital controls effective
• FX constraint NOT yet binding

Policy implication:
PBoC can ease domestically **without triggering FX stress** — for now.

FX only becomes binding if:
• Easing accelerates materially
• External shock hits (tariffs, USD surge)
• Confidence deteriorates further

Rates

• Front-end anchored by ample liquidity
• Curve pressured by fiscal issuance
• No tightening bias

Equities

Bifurcation is extreme:

OVERWEIGHT:
• Export / Caixin-exposed sectors
• High-tech manufacturing
• Strategic policy sectors

UNDERWEIGHT:
• Consumer discretionary
• Property
• Domestic SOE cyclicals

Commodities

• Not collapsing
• Not reflating
• Range-bound pending fiscal clarity

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REGIME VERDICT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SIGNALS SHIFT — CONFIRMED

China is not collapsing, but **domestic demand is failing**.
Exports buy time.
Policy response will be **targeted, fiscal-heavy, FX-aware**.

The next inflection is **March NPC**, not a data print.

CHINA — LIVE MACRO DATA  
Rolling window: 4 weeks  
Window: January 5 – February 9, 2026  

=====================================================================
WEEK 4 (FEB 2 – FEB 9, 2026)
=====================================================================

MONDAY 03 FEB

CHINA — Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Jan)

Actual: 50.3  
Prior: 50.1  
(NBS Manufacturing PMI: 49.3)

HF sensitivity:
Dominant signal: CRITICAL DIVERGENCE between Caixin PMI (50.3) and NBS PMI (49.3).  
This confirms the regime diagnosis: PRIVATE / EXPORT-ORIENTED firms remain in expansion, while STATE / DOMESTIC-oriented firms are in contraction.  
This points to DOMESTIC DEMAND COLLAPSE rather than external weakness.

Implications embedded in the data:
• Export sector holding up, helped by CNY depreciation  
• Domestic consumption and SOE-driven activity remain weak  
• Monetary easing alone (credit/RRR) insufficient without demand-side support

Secondary signal:
Caixin above 50 indicates no hard landing yet — this is a bifurcated economy, not a collapse.

Noise:
Lunar New Year seasonality affects January PMIs across both surveys.

Reaction-function relevance (PBoC):
Divergence argues for targeted stimulus (consumption, property support, fiscal transfers) rather than broad SOE credit easing.

=====================================================================
WEEK 3 (JAN 23 – JAN 30, 2026)
=====================================================================

FRIDAY 31 JAN

Sub-indices:
• Production: 50.6 (expansion)  
• New Orders: 49.2 (contraction)  
• New Export Orders: 47.8 (contraction)

Professional commentary (public sources):
• NBS Chief Statistician Huo Lihui: PMI declined due to seasonal factors and insufficient effective demand.  
• High-tech manufacturing PMI: 52.0 (second month >52)  
• Equipment manufacturing: 50.1  
• Consumer goods: 48.3  
• High energy-consuming industries: 47.9  

HF sensitivity:
Dominant signal: Return to contraction after December’s brief rebound.  
Confirms that domestic demand remains insufficient, despite firms maintaining production.

Secondary signal:
Sub-indices show a classic destocking pattern — production > orders.

Noise:
January seasonality (Lunar New Year) argues against panic on a single print.

Reaction-function relevance:
Reinforces case for incremental policy easing and fiscal support, not emergency stimulus.

CHINA (CNY) MACRO — LIVE MONTH VIEW (JANUARY 2026)
STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY 31 JAN close

FRIDAY 31 JAN — RELEASED

CHINA — NBS MANUFACTURING PMI (JAN)
• 50.1 (prior 49.5)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: manufacturing moved back to the expansion threshold, but only marginally. This is stabilization, not re-acceleration.
Secondary: the level matters less than the lack of momentum — a one-off rebound after prior weakness does not change the growth regime.
Noise: PMI diffusion around 50 is sensitive to inventory cycles and seasonal distortions.
Reaction-function impact (PBoC / policymakers): supports the “targeted support is sufficient for now” stance; no urgency for broad easing.
Transmission: limited FX impact; marginal support to cyclical sentiment but insufficient to drive CNY.

MONDAY 20 JAN — RELEASED

CHINA — LOAN PRIME RATE 1Y (JAN)
• 3.00% (unchanged)

CHINA — LOAN PRIME RATE 5Y (JAN)
• 3.50% (unchanged)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: policy inaction is the signal. Authorities deliberately avoided easing despite soft demand data.
Secondary: keeping the 5Y LPR unchanged confirms reluctance to re-stimulate property aggressively.
Noise: none — this was a conscious policy choice.
Reaction-function impact: reinforces the regime of fiscal-led support + liquidity abundance, not rate-led stimulus.
Transmission: CNY stability favored; bond yields anchored; property equities disappointed.

MONDAY 19 JAN — RELEASED (THE CORE GROWTH BLOCK)

CHINA — GDP y/y (Q4)
• 4.5% vs cons 4.4% (prior 4.8%)

CHINA — GDP q/q SA (Q4)
• 1.2% vs cons 1.0%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: growth slightly better than feared, but still on a downshifting trajectory. This is not reflation; it is managed deceleration.
Secondary: sequential momentum held up better than y/y optics suggest, which reduces near-term hard-landing risk.
Noise: headline GDP smoothing remains a constraint — corroboration must come from activity details.
Reaction-function impact: no pressure for emergency easing; validates policymakers’ preference for gradualism.
Transmission: neutral for CNY; supportive for risk sentiment but not a catalyst.

CHINA — RETAIL SALES y/y (DEC)
• 0.9% vs cons 1.2% (prior 1.3%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: domestic demand remains the weak link. Consumption failed to respond meaningfully to prior support.
Secondary: confirms that household confidence, not liquidity, is the binding constraint.
Noise: holiday timing can distort December, but trend remains soft.
Reaction-function impact: increases pressure on fiscal tools (consumption subsidies, transfers), not monetary easing.
Transmission: negative for China-beta assets; reinforces CNY stability bias over appreciation.

CHINA — INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT y/y (DEC)
• 5.2% vs cons 5.0% (prior 4.8%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: industry remains the growth anchor. Export-linked manufacturing is carrying activity.
Secondary: resilience is increasingly external-demand driven, not domestic.
Noise: inventory cycles matter, but trend is clearly stronger than consumption.
Reaction-function impact: allows policymakers to tolerate weak retail without panic.
Transmission: supports commodity demand narrative more than FX.

CHINA — URBAN FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT ytd y/y (DEC)
• -3.8% vs cons -3.0%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: investment contraction deepened — property drag still dominant.
Secondary: infrastructure spending is insufficient to offset real-estate decline.
Noise: YTD metric smooths late-year moves, but direction is unambiguous.
Reaction-function impact: reinforces the case for targeted fiscal support, not rate cuts.
Transmission: negative for construction-linked sectors; caps China reflation trades.

CHINA — URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (DEC)
• 5.1% (unchanged)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: labor market stability is being preserved — a political priority.
Secondary: stability here allows policymakers to delay aggressive stimulus despite weak demand.
Noise: headline unemployment masks underemployment and youth stress.
Reaction-function impact: supports policy patience.
Transmission: neutral.

WEDNESDAY 15 JAN — RELEASED (LIQUIDITY ≠ IMPULSE)

CHINA — M2 MONEY SUPPLY y/y (DEC)
• 8.5% vs cons 8.0%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: liquidity remains abundant, but this is not translating into demand.
Secondary: reinforces the “pushing on a string” diagnosis.
Noise: base effects matter, but trend is steady.
Reaction-function impact: policymakers comfortable maintaining ample liquidity without further cuts.
Transmission: bond-friendly; FX neutral.

CHINA — TOTAL SOCIAL FINANCING (DEC)
• 2.21tn CNY vs cons 2.00tn

CHINA — NEW YUAN LOANS (DEC)
• 910bn CNY vs cons 800bn

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: credit volume surprised on the upside, but quality and usage remain questionable.
Secondary: corporates are borrowing; households remain cautious.
Noise: year-end front-loading inflates December prints.
Reaction-function impact: reduces urgency for broad stimulus; policymakers can claim policy traction.
Transmission: supportive for credit markets; limited FX effect.

TUESDAY 14 JAN — RELEASED (EXTERNAL SURPLUS DOMINATES)

CHINA — EXPORTS y/y (DEC)
• 6.6% vs cons 3.0%

CHINA — IMPORTS y/y (DEC)
• 5.7% vs cons 0.9%

CHINA — TRADE BALANCE (USD, DEC)
• $114.1bn vs cons $113.6bn

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: external sector is the growth stabilizer. Exports beat convincingly, and imports rebounded, pointing to supply-chain strength rather than domestic demand revival.
Secondary: composition suggests non-US markets carried growth.
Noise: seasonal distortions exist, but surplus magnitude is structural.
Reaction-function impact: reinforces preference for currency stability — no incentive to weaken CNY.
Transmission: supports regional FX stability; offsets domestic softness.

FRIDAY 9 JAN — RELEASED (PRICE SIGNALS)

CHINA — CPI y/y (DEC)
• 0.8% vs cons 0.8%

CHINA — PPI y/y (DEC)
• -1.9% vs cons -2.0%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: deflation risk persists at the producer level, while consumer inflation remains subdued.
Secondary: margin pressure remains a corporate constraint.
Noise: energy base effects distort PPI slightly.
Reaction-function impact: keeps easing bias alive, but not urgent.
Transmission: bond-supportive; limits CNY upside.

MONDAY 5 JAN — RELEASED

CHINA — SERVICES PMI (DEC)
• 52.1 (prior 52.0)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: services expansion continues but without acceleration.
Secondary: supports GDP stability but not reflation.
Reaction-function impact: neutral.

MONTH SYNTHESIS (CHINA) — JANUARY 2026

What actually mattered
Dominant signal: China remains externally supported, internally constrained. Exports and industry carry growth; consumption and investment do not.
Secondary: liquidity is ample, but the credit impulse is weak in transmission, not supply.

What did not
Headline PMI moves, risk scores, and minor CPI fluctuations added little incremental information.

Reaction function (policymakers)
Authorities remain firmly in “targeted support + fiscal delivery” mode. No appetite for broad monetary easing; currency stability is a priority. The policy bias is accommodative but deliberately restrained.

Market transmission / tradeable regime
– FX (CNY): stability bias; upside capped, downside defended.
– Rates: supportive for bonds; no pressure for aggressive easing.
– Equities / commodities: selective — exporters and industrials favored over domestic consumption.

What would change the regime
Bullish: sustained improvement in retail sales and private investment.
Bearish: renewed export slowdown or labor market deterioration forcing stimulus escalation.

<<LIVE_CHINA_MACRO_END>>



<<<CHINA_MACRO_NOTE_BEGIN>>>

1) Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information (written last)

Macro regime (1–2 lines)
China remains in an “external cushion / domestic drag” regime. External demand (trade) is outperforming and reducing near-term stimulus urgency, while domestic momentum remains conditional on credit transmission and the property channel.

What changed in the PRIMARY window (Jan 5–Jan 16)

External impulse materially stronger than priced: exports and imports both beat expectations, and the trade surplus remains exceptionally large (Jan 14).

Credit impulse improved: TSF and new yuan loans beat consensus (Jan 15), signaling policy traction — but without evidence of broad-based acceleration.

Inflation constraint unchanged: CPI remains very low; PPI is less negative but still deflationary — reflation is incremental, not regime-changing.

What did NOT change (anchors)

The binding constraint remains domestic demand, especially consumption and property.

The political external-risk channel tied to a persistent surplus remains intact.

Reaction-function interpretation (policy asymmetry)

Policy asymmetry remains dovish-but-controlled: low inflation allows accommodation, but the binding constraint is credit transmission and FX stability, not liquidity levels.

Stronger trade + credit data reduce the probability of an immediate “shock stimulus”, but do not eliminate convexity if domestic data deteriorate.

Explicit regime-change triggers

Hawkish / less easing trigger: faster-than-expected reflation (PPI toward zero, core CPI acceleration) or FX pressure.

Dovish / stronger support trigger: renewed domestic demand weakness (retail sales, IP, FAI) or renewed property stress that impairs confidence and credit transmission.

2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Primary window: Jan 5–Jan 16, 2026
Source: LIVE_EM_MACRO (user-provided)

Jan 15, 2026 — Total Social Financing (Dec)

Actual: 2,210bn | Consensus: 2,000bn | Prior: 2,490bn

Signal: Clear beat vs consensus, but down vs prior — positive impulse, not a flood.

HF take: Markets trade China on credit impulse, not levels. This print reduces the tail risk of “credit too tight” but confirms a targeted, controlled easing stance. Primary transmission via CNH and EM risk sentiment, not domestic rates.

Jan 15, 2026 — New Yuan Loans (Dec)

Actual: 910bn | Consensus: 800bn | Prior: 390bn

Signal: Strong beat and sharp jump vs prior.

HF take: This is the most market-relevant domestic signal in the window. However, composition matters (household vs corporate; long vs short maturities). Without evidence of household/property re-engagement, this supports “traction” but not a regime shift.

Jan 15, 2026 — M2 Money Supply y/y (Dec)

Actual: 8.5% | Consensus: 8.0% | Prior: 8.0%

Signal: Upside vs both consensus and prior.

HF take: Confirms accommodative liquidity conditions. Necessary but not sufficient: M2 can rise even with weak private demand. This is confirmation of policy stance, not proof of domestic recovery.

Jan 15, 2026 — Outstanding Loan Growth y/y (Dec)

Actual: 6.4% | Consensus: 6.3% | Prior: 6.4%

Signal: Flat trend.

HF take: Reinforces the “flow vs stock” distinction. Structural credit acceleration is absent; regime remains targeted support with uneven transmission.

Jan 14, 2026 — Exports y/y (Dec)

Actual: +6.6% | Consensus: +3.0% | Prior: +5.9%

Signal: Large upside surprise and acceleration vs prior.

HF take: First-order regime signal. External demand continues to stabilize growth optics and reduces stimulus urgency, but reinforces the political surplus risk channel.

Jan 14, 2026 — Imports y/y (Dec)

Actual: +5.7% | Consensus: +0.9% | Prior: +1.9%

Signal: Very large upside surprise.

HF take: Softens the “domestic absorption is collapsing” narrative. However, imports can be price- or commodity-driven; confirmation must come from domestic activity data.

Jan 14, 2026 — Trade Balance (USD, Dec)

Actual: 114.10bn | Consensus: 113.60bn | Prior: 111.68bn

Signal: Surplus remains extremely large and persistent.

HF take: Supports CNH via balance-of-payments dynamics, but raises external political risk. Markets care more about impulse than level, but policy risk rises with persistence.

Jan 9, 2026 — CPI y/y (Dec)

Actual: 0.8% | Consensus: 0.8% | Prior: 0.7%

Signal: Lowflation unchanged.

HF take: No inflation constraint on policy. However, low CPI also reflects weak demand — not a growth positive on its own.

Jan 9, 2026 — CPI m/m (Dec)

Actual: 0.2% | Consensus: 0.1% | Prior: -0.1%

Signal: Sequential rebound vs prior.

HF take: Mostly seasonal / second-order. Useful mainly as confirmation that deflation risks are not worsening.

Jan 9, 2026 — PPI y/y (Dec)

Actual: -1.9% | Consensus: -2.0% | Prior: -2.2%

Signal: Marginal reflation (less negative).

HF take: Slightly reduces profit-squeeze tail risk, but remains firmly deflationary. Does not alter the policy regime.

Jan 5, 2026 — RatingDog Services PMI (Dec)

Actual: 52.1 | Consensus: 52.0 | Prior: n/a

Signal: Above 50 with a marginal beat.

HF take: Services activity continues to grind higher — not accelerating, but acting as an anti-tail against a broader domestic rollover.

3) Top-Down Macro

Growth impulse (dominant channel): external > domestic
Trade surprises dominate the short-term growth signal. Credit data reduce downside tails but do not prove a durable domestic upswing.

Demand (binding constraint)
Liquidity is ample (M2), but credit transmission and confidence remain the constraint. Without household/property re-engagement, domestic demand stays conditional.

Prices
Low CPI and marginally improving PPI preserve policy flexibility. Reflation remains gradual and insufficient to force a policy pivot.

Labour / income (omitted)
No labour or household income indicators were provided in LIVE_EM for this window; therefore omitted by construction.

Financial conditions / FX
External surplus supports CNH stability. The dominant FX risk channel is political, not inflationary.

Rolling regime assessment (1–2 months)
MIXED — confirms stabilization via the external sector with domestically conditional momentum.

4) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Latest policy stance (PBoC)

Recent action: targeted rate reductions on structural tools (~25bp), framed within a “moderately accommodative” stance.

Rationale: support growth and credit transmission without broad-based easing.

Implied trajectory: dovish bias with tight control; binding constraints are financial stability, FX, and transmission quality — not inflation.

Named communication (within verified window)

Zou Lan (PBoC Vice Governor, Jan): confirmed targeted easing via structural tools, reinforcing controlled accommodation.

5) Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Short-term (current window):
No market-moving political events provided in LIVE_EM.

Last 1 month (context):

Property stabilization measures (urban renewal, inventory absorption) reduce free-fall tail risk but depend on execution.

External policy backdrop: persistent surplus increases trade-policy and geopolitical risk premia.

Rolling assessment (1–3 months):
Political backdrop remains unchanged in direction: stabilize property without a major reflation push, accept export-led cushioning despite external risk.

HF synthesis:
Political risk bias: higher externally, unchanged domestically. Dominant channel: trade surplus → policy risk premia.

6) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Short-term attribution

Rates: stronger trade + credit cap aggressive easing expectations; low inflation preserves dovish asymmetry.

FX: surplus supports CNH; upside constrained by policy management and political risk.

Structural (1–3 months)

Rates: targeted easing regime caps front-end yields; durable bear steepening requires genuine domestic reflation.

FX: structurally supported but tightly managed; appreciation limited by policy preference and external optics.

Consistency with political assessment
FX and rates implications reflect surplus-driven political risk as the dominant non-macro constraint.
