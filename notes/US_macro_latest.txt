???? EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 4 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 19 Dec 2025 – 2 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & reaction-function context): past ~1 month

====================================================

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information
====================================================

Macro regime (unchanged):
Euro area remains in a low-trend / soft-landing regime: services-led expansion, persistent manufacturing drag, inflation converging toward target, and the ECB holding a restrictive plateau with high optionality.

What is NEW in the primary window (19 Dec – 2 Jan):

The cycle split sharpened: hard data and ECB projections support a “growth floor”, but manufacturing momentum deteriorated into year-end (final PMI revised down, orders/export orders weakening).

ECB’s latest decision remains the regime anchor (18 Dec): rates held, projections revised to firmer near-term growth and slower services disinflation, reinforcing “hold for longer” and legitimising the market debate around late-2026 hikes (timing, not direction).

Professional narrative deep-search outcome (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources): the dominant read is “stabilisation, not rebound; services inflation persistence is the constraint; manufacturing weakness is a tail risk unless it spills into labour/services.” The key nuance professionals emphasise is composition + revisions, not the headline levels.

What did NOT change:

The ECB’s binding constraint is still underlying/services inflation and wage transmission, not headline volatility.

Manufacturing remains a drag but not yet a regime-breaker absent labour spillover.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Hawkish tail: services inflation fails to cool / wages decelerate less than projected ? plateau extends; front-end reprices “higher for longer”.

Dovish tail: services demand/employment components roll over + clearer wage deceleration + core momentum drops ? ECB can pivot toward easing optionality faster.

====================================================
2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Fri 2 Jan 2026 – Euro area Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

PMI: 48.8 / 49.2 (prelim) / 49.6 (Nov)
Signal (surprise + momentum + “what pros highlighted”):

Downward revision versus prelim and clear sequential weakening versus Nov; the professional focus is on the orders complex (new + export orders) and the fact that production slipped back into contraction.
HF take:

Keeps the growth distribution skewed left even in a soft-landing regime; it’s not just “below 50”, it’s worsening breadth.

ECB implication: by itself, this does not force dovishness; it raises the spillover question (when/if weak goods demand transmits into services employment and wage bargaining).

Thu 18 Dec 2025 – ECB policy decision + staff projections (Governing Council)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Deposit rate: 2.00% (HOLD) / HOLD / 2.00%

Staff projections (selected, averages):
• Headline HICP: 2025 2.1 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.8 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
• HICP ex energy & food: 2025 2.4 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 2.2 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
Signal (what changed vs the prior framework):

Inflation revised up for 2026 mainly because services inflation is expected to decline more slowly; growth expected to be stronger than September projections, driven especially by domestic demand.
HF take:

This is the reaction-function anchor: “plateau + confirmation” is reinforced; cuts are not mechanically imminent.

The market’s late-2026 hike chatter is best read as a services-persistence tail being priced, not a base case of re-acceleration.

Wed 17 Dec 2025 – Euro area HICP (Nov, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Headline y/y: 2.1 / n/a (final prints typically not separately surveyed; prelim consensus was ~2.1) / 2.1 (Oct)

Core y/y: 2.4 / n/a (same convention as above) / 2.4 (Oct)

Services y/y: 3.5 / n/a / 3.4 (Oct)
Signal (composition + “what pros highlighted”):

The non-obvious focus is services inflation re-accelerating at the margin (even while headline sits near target), consistent with the ECB’s projection change (slower services disinflation).
HF take:

This print is consistent with “near-target headline”, but it tightens the constraint on easing optionality: services/wages must do the disinflation work.

The risk is not a headline re-acceleration; it’s persistence that keeps policy restrictive longer than a naïve “headline ˜ 2%” read implies.

Context / regime anchors from this execution chat (treated as anchors; fully integrated):

Euro area Industrial Production (Oct; published 15 Dec): +0.8% m/m; prior +0.2% m/m.

Euro area Trade (Oct; published 16 Dec): trade surplus improved vs 3Q average; pros emphasise lower imports and intra-Europe support.

Germany Industrial Production (Oct; published 8 Dec): +1.8% m/m vs +0.4% expected; pros treat it as stabilisation, not recovery (construction boost + still weak three-month trend).

Country inflation finals (Nov): Germany HICP 2.6% y/y; Spain ~3.0–3.1% y/y; Italy HICP ~1.1% y/y; France CPI ex-tobacco modest m/m gains.

====================================================
3) Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources)

Base case: stabilisation, not rebound; growth floor intact but weak, with limited upside torque.

Key debate: services inflation persistence vs wage moderation — how quickly does underlying inflation converge once energy/base effects fade?

Tail 1 (hawkish): services persistence + resilient domestic demand ? plateau extends; late-2026 hike tail gets fatter.

Tail 2 (dovish): manufacturing drag spills into labour/services ? earlier easing optionality returns.

EVIDENCE MAP (explicitly tied to Section 2 + chat anchors)
Activity:

Oct IP +0.8% m/m (anchor) supports stabilisation; but Dec manufacturing PMI 48.8 (2 Jan) shows renewed goods weakness and worsening orders ? caps upside and increases spillover risk.
Demand:

ECB projections (18 Dec) cite stronger domestic-demand support vs Sep ? consistent with services resilience; manufacturing orders contradict a broad demand re-acceleration.
Prices:

HICP headline stable at 2.1 but services 3.5 (17 Dec) + ECB projection change (slower services disinflation) ? the inflation constraint is concentrated in services/wages, not headline.
Financial conditions / risk premium:

Manufacturing deterioration primarily transmits via risk premium and corporate caution (capex/hiring), unless confirmed by labour/service indicators.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)

The euro area is in a two-speed regime: services resilience is the stabiliser; manufacturing/export demand is the drag.

The ECB’s constraint is not “where headline is today”, it is whether services inflation decelerates durably as wages cool.

The key convexity is spillover: if manufacturing weakness remains contained, the ECB can hold; if it spills into labour/services, the reaction function shifts dovish quickly.

BINDING CONSTRAINT + next print that matters

Binding constraint: services inflation persistence / wage transmission.

Next print that matters: any reliable update on services inflation momentum, wage/negotiated wage indicators, and services employment (i.e., evidence that services disinflation is accelerating or stalling).

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS soft-landing / low-trend, with (i) manufacturing downside tail and (ii) services-inflation persistence tail.

====================================================
4) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections (MANDATORY)
ECB Governing Council – 18 Dec 2025

Policy decision

Deposit facility rate: 2.00%

Decision type: HOLD

Decision rationale (reaction-function read)

Inflation expected to stabilise at target in the medium term; policy remains sufficiently restrictive; emphasis on underlying inflation and persistence.

Projections framework (published)

Headline HICP averages: 2025 2.1; 2026 1.9; 2027 1.8; 2028 2.0

Core (ex energy & food) averages: 2025 2.4; 2026 2.2; 2027 1.9; 2028 2.0

Key change: 2026 inflation revised up mainly due to slower services disinflation; growth revised stronger than Sep, driven by domestic demand.
Implied trajectory:

Base case is restrictive plateau; easing optionality is conditional on services/wages confirmation (not on one weak manufacturing print).

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)
Rehn (GC member) – 19 Dec 2025

Core message: outlook highly uncertain due to trade/geopolitics; risks remain meaningful despite some positive developments.

Bias: neutral (risk-management framing)

Adds/changes: reinforces that external uncertainty is a live tail, keeping optionality high.

Lagarde (President) – 18 Dec 2025 (press conference)

Core message: hold; confidence improving but persistence risks remain; full data-dependence.

Bias: neutral-to-hawkish (plateau defended)

Adds/changes: aligns messaging with projection change — underlying/services persistence matters more than headline comfort.

Mandatory HF synthesis (reaction-function snapshot)

Reaction function: “Hold on a restrictive plateau until services/underlying inflation convincingly slows; treat manufacturing weakness as a tail unless labour/services spillover emerges.”

What changed in the last month: stronger institutional comfort with plateau persistence, driven by services inflation dynamics and projection revisions.

====================================================
5) Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Political guideline applied (macro transmission only; short-horizon + rolling assessment).

In-window (19 Dec – 2 Jan): key political/fiscal channel is France fiscal uncertainty / budget politics and its second-order impact on confidence and risk premium, rather than an immediate mechanical hit to macro prints.

Transmission: policy uncertainty ? business confidence / capex caution ? services hiring at the margin; also sovereign-spread risk premium channel (financial conditions).

Rolling (past ~1 month): trade-policy uncertainty remains a structural tail for the euro area via the export/manufacturing channel, particularly Germany’s export complex; this matters because the current regime’s fragility is concentrated in manufacturing orders (consistent with the PMI deterioration).

Bottom line: politics is not the base-case growth driver in this window, but it fattens tails (confidence + risk premium) exactly where the regime is weakest (manufacturing + spillover risk).

====================================================
6) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (macro-driven)

Front-end: anchored by ECB plateau; sensitivity highest to services inflation / wage confirmation and to communication validating/invalidating “hold for longer”.

Curve/term premium: capped by low-trend growth; steepening risk is primarily “services persistence” rather than “growth acceleration”.

EUR (relative by construction)

Support: credible inflation convergence + ECB plateau vs peers with more easing bias; stabilising hard data anchors the “no recession” floor.

Drag: renewed manufacturing contraction and weakening orders; political risk premium tail (France) can intermittently weigh via spreads.

EUR trigger map:
• EUR-positive: services persistence + ECB plateau longer without growth accident.
• EUR-negative: services/labour rollover + earlier easing optionality.

Consensus lens (professional narrative consistency check)

Macro consensus: stabilisation, not rebound; manufacturing weak; services resilient.

ECB path consensus: hold near-term; next move timing uncertain; tails include “next move hike” conditional on services persistence.

FX consensus: range-bound; driven by relative rates and risk premium.
