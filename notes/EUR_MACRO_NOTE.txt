EUR LIVE MACRO NOTE — HF RUN  
Date: 9 February 2026  
Rolling window: past 4 weeks  
Primary assessment point: early-March ECB meeting

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — REGIME
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REGIME

Disinflationary undershoot is now colliding with emerging growth fragility.  
The ECB remains on a conditional hold, but the balance of risks has shifted away from the January narrative of domestic resilience.

The regime has moved from *“manufacturing weakness is contained”* to *“manufacturing weakness may spill into consumption and services.”*  
Inflation below target now coincides with weakening demand, tightening real conditions endogenously.

This is not yet a regime break, but it is a **clear inflection point** ahead of March.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2) KEY MACRO RELEASES — 4W ROLLING WINDOW (SIGNAL ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### Inflation (ECB binding constraint)

EURO AREA — HICP Flash (Jan, Feb 4)  
• **1.7% y/y** vs **2.0% cons** (prior **1.9%**)  
• Core **2.2%** vs **2.3% cons**  
• Services **3.2%** (from **3.4%**)  
HF take: Broad-based cooling (not just energy). Policy relevance comes from coincidence with weakening growth, but services inflation remains too high to unlock easing.

FRANCE — HICP prelim (Jan)  
• **0.4% y/y** vs **0.6% cons**  
HF take: Reinforces EA undershoot bloc, but ECB still gates on EA-wide services and wages.

---

### Demand / growth (spillover question)

EURO AREA — Retail Sales (Dec)  
• **-0.5% m/m** vs **-0.2% cons**  
• **+1.3% y/y** vs **+1.6% cons** (prior **+2.4%**)  
HF take: First hard evidence that consumption is no longer insulating the cycle.

GERMANY — Industrial Production (Dec)  
• **-1.9% m/m** vs **-0.3% cons**  
HF take: Core hard-data shock. Forces reassessment of spillover from manufacturing into demand.

GERMANY — Factory Orders (Dec)  
• **+7.8% m/m** vs **-2.2% cons**  
HF take: Distorted by aircraft/defence one-offs. Orders do not override production signal.

---

### Services momentum

EURO AREA — Services PMI Final (Jan)  
• **51.6** vs **51.9 cons**  
HF take: Still expansionary, but momentum is rolling over across countries.

SPAIN — Services PMI (Jan)  
• **53.5** vs **56.6 cons**  
HF take: Deceleration in the bloc’s strongest economy weakens the “resilience” narrative.

---

### Policy

ECB — Deposit Rate (Feb 5)  
• **2.00% (HOLD)**  
HF take: Decision itself is neutral; reaction function matters (see Section 4).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3) TOP-DOWN MACRO — REGIME MECHANICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DOMINANT FORCE

A simultaneous disinflationary undershoot and weakening demand impulse.  
This matters because it raises real rates mechanically while eroding income and confidence.

---

ACTIVITY

Manufacturing remains in deep contraction across the euro area.  
Germany’s industrial production collapse confirms that weakness is real, not survey noise.  
Orders volatility does not alter the signal: production dominates.

Services continue to expand, but breadth and momentum are deteriorating.  
Spain’s sharp PMI drop is particularly important, as it undermines the assumption that peripheral strength offsets core weakness.

---

SPILLOVER ASSESSMENT (MANUFACTURING → SERVICES)

Channels:
• Income: production weakness → employment risk → consumption  
• Confidence: recession narrative + political uncertainty → precautionary saving  
• Credit: capex restraint persists despite ECB cuts

Evidence so far:
• Retail sales contraction = first hard spillover signal  
• Services PMIs softening = early corroboration  
• Labour remains stable (lagging indicator)

Conclusion: spillover is **emerging but not confirmed**. March data is decisive.

---

DEMAND

Consumption is weakening despite rising real incomes, implying elevated precautionary saving.  
Investment remains subdued; ECB cuts have not transmitted meaningfully, suggesting lags and structural constraints.

---

PRICES

Goods deflation is entrenched via weak demand, China overcapacity, and EUR strength.  
Services inflation has started to decelerate but remains well above target-consistent levels.  
Wage drift keeps total compensation elevated, sustaining ECB caution.

---

LABOUR

Labour markets remain stable, but this is a lagging condition.  
Manufacturing job losses would surface with a 3–6 month delay if weakness persists.

---

MACRO CONCLUSION

The euro area has moved from a “contained weakness” regime to a fragile equilibrium.  
March determines whether February marked noise or the start of a new phase.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4) ECB REACTION FUNCTION — DETAILED (QUOTES KEPT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The ECB is operating a **conditional plateau**, not a directional easing path.

Inflation side:
• Lagarde: inflation “**cannot be hostage to one data point**”  
• Services inflation “**above target-consistent levels**”  
• Wage drift contribution “**uncertain**”  
• Lane: requires “**several quarters**” of confirmation

Growth side:
• Manufacturing weakness no longer dismissed as isolated  
• Retail contraction opens the spillover debate

FX side:
• Lagarde: euro “**not a target, but important**”  
• ECB “**keeping a close eye**” on EUR  
• Inflation below policy rate implies passive tightening if EUR remains firm

Snapshot:
Policy: HOLD (2.00%)  
Bias: Two-sided  
Binding constraint: services + wages  
Gatekeeper: Lane

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5) POLITICAL / FISCAL CHANNEL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FRANCE

Budget gridlock and deficit risk (>5%) weigh on confidence.  
Villeroy’s resignation removes a dovish stabiliser within the GC.  
Transmission is second-order but active via precautionary saving and risk premia.

GERMANY

Fiscal ambition exists but is not transmitting into activity.  
February data show no multiplier effect.  
German fiscal remains a 2027 story, not a 2026 growth driver.

Political risk bias: neutral to mildly downside, primarily through confidence.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6) CROSS-MARKET TRANSMISSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RATES

Front-end anchored by the Lane framework.  
Downside reprices faster than upside if growth weakness persists.  
Curve bias: mild steepening if February weakness is confirmed.

FX (EUR)

Support: ECB still restrictive relative to peers.  
Drag: growth underperformance, inflation undershoot, political uncertainty.

Key conditional trigger:
Sustained EUR strength combined with HICP <1.8% would force ECB acknowledgement of passive tightening.

CONSISTENCY CHECK

Macro regime, ECB stance, rates, FX, and politics are internally consistent.  
The system is at an inflection point — **March decides**.

EUR MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (FEB 2–6, 2026)
STATUS: Live as of Friday close
MODE: LIVE (HF sensitivity) — releases only, day-by-day
FOCUS: signal hierarchy • reaction function • transmission
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRIOR WEEK REGIME CONTEXT (Jan 26-30):
"Euro Area growth surprise to the upside (Q4 GDP 0.3% vs 0.2 expected) alongside lower unemployment (6.2%) cements the 'EA resilience' narrative into early 2026. This is not an export-led story — it's domestic-demand cushioning while exports remain the structural drag."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SUNDAY 02 FEB — RELEASED
GERMANY — Retail Sales Real MM (Dec)

Actual: +0.1% vs Consensus: +0.2% vs Prior: -0.5% (revised from -0.6%)
YY: +1.5% vs Consensus: +1.1% vs Prior: -1.6% (revised from +1.1%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: German consumption stabilizing after November drop - December rebound modest but positive
Secondary signal: YY comp shows improvement (1.5% from -1.6% prior revised) but low consensus accuracy raises data quality concerns
Noise: December seasonality (holiday spending patterns) limits clean trend read
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Neutral - consumption not collapsing but not accelerating either
Transmission: Weak consumption → limited domestic demand support for services inflation (3-6mo lag)
SPAIN — HCOB Manufacturing PMI (Jan)

Actual: 49.2 vs Prior: 49.6 vs Consensus: 49.3

ITALY — HCOB Manufacturing PMI (Jan)

Actual: 48.1 vs Prior: 47.9 vs Consensus: 47.9

FRANCE — HCOB Manufacturing PMI (Jan)

Actual: 51.2 vs Prior: 51.0 vs Consensus: 51.0

GERMANY — HCOB Manufacturing PMI (Jan)

Actual: 49.1 vs Prior: 48.7 vs Consensus: 48.7

EURO ZONE — HCOB Manufacturing PMI Final (Jan)

Actual: 49.5 vs Prior: 49.4 vs Consensus: 49.4

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Euro Zone manufacturing still in contraction (49.5 <50) for 30th consecutive month - France only major economy in expansion
Secondary signal: Germany slight improvement (49.1 from 48.7) but still weak; Italy/Spain both contracting
Noise: Manufacturing is known drag; services matter more for EA growth
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Already priced - manufacturing weakness is structural (competitiveness loss to China, energy costs), not cyclical
Transmission: Manufacturing → exports/capex drag continues, but doesn't force ECB action unless services collapse
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MONDAY 03 FEB — RELEASED
FRANCE — CPI (EU Norm) Prelim YY (Jan)

Actual: 0.4% vs Consensus: 0.6% vs Prior: 0.7% — beat on disinflation
MM: -0.4% vs Consensus: -0.2% vs Prior: +0.1%

FRANCE — CPI Prelim YY NSA (Jan)

Actual: 0.3% vs Consensus: 0.6% vs Prior: 0.8%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: French inflation collapsed to 0.4% YY (EU norm) - lowest in Euro Area alongside Cyprus
Secondary signal: MM deflation (-0.4%) sharper than expected - driven by energy base effects + services cooling
Noise: January seasonal adjustments (post-holiday price corrections)
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Dovish on French component - reinforces "below-target inflation" narrative building into Zone-wide flash
Transmission: France is 2nd-largest EA economy - sharp disinflation here pulls Zone aggregate down, reduces ECB urgency to hold restrictive stance
SPAIN — International Tourist Arrivals (Dec)

Actual: 8,789.627k vs Prior: 9,224.277k

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Tourism sector seasonal decline - not macro-critical
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Actual: 51.4 vs Prior: 50.3

FRANCE — HCOB Services PMI (Jan)

Actual: 48.4 vs Consensus: 47.9 vs Prior: 47.9 — small beat but still contraction

FRANCE — HCOB Composite PMI (Jan)

Actual: 49.1 vs Consensus: 48.6 vs Prior: 48.6 — beat but contraction

GERMANY — HCOB Services PMI (Jan)

Actual: 52.4 vs Consensus: 53.3 vs Prior: 53.3 — MISS

GERMANY — HCOB Composite PMI Final (Jan)

Actual: 52.1 vs Consensus: 52.5 vs Prior: 52.5

EURO ZONE — HCOB Services PMI Final (Jan)

Actual: 51.6 vs Consensus: 51.9 vs Prior: 51.9 — miss

EURO ZONE — HCOB Composite PMI Final (Jan)

Actual: 51.3 vs Consensus: 51.5 vs Prior: 51.5 — miss

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Euro Zone services momentum slowing (51.6 from 51.9) - the "domestic resilience" story softening
Secondary signal: France STILL IN CONTRACTION (48.4) despite small beat - Germany slowing (52.4 from 53.3) - only Italy improving
Noise: PMI shifts <1pp typically noise, but directional trend (all major economies softer) matters
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Mildly dovish - services slowdown reduces upside inflation risk from wage pass-through
Transmission: Services activity → services inflation (2-3mo lag) - if sustained, supports faster disinflation path
EURO ZONE — HICP Flash YY (Jan)

Actual: 1.7% vs Consensus: 2.0% vs Prior: 1.9% — MAJOR UNDERSHOOT

EURO ZONE — HICP-X F&E Flash YY (Jan) [core ex food/energy]

Actual: 2.2% vs Consensus: 2.3% vs Prior: 2.3%

EURO ZONE — HICP-X F,E,A&T Flash YY (Jan) [super-core ex food/energy/alcohol/tobacco]

Actual: 2.2% vs Consensus: 2.3% vs Prior: 2.3%

EURO ZONE — HICP-X F,E,A,T Flash MM (Jan)

Actual: -1.10% vs Prior: +0.30%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Majority view: Inflation fell below 2% ECB target for first time since May, driven by energy base effects (-4.1% YY) and services cooling to 3.2% from 3.4% (major European banks, BNP Paribas)
→ Core inflation (2.2%) at lowest since October 2021 - signals "sticky services inflation finally drawing to a close" (currency analysts)
→ Minority view: ECB unlikely to cut despite undershoot - "high bar for policy action, next move could be hike" given medium-term upside risks (BNP Paribas Head of DM Economics Paul Hollingsworth)
→ Key debate: Is disinflation sustainable or temporary? Services still 3.2% (well above target) vs headline 1.7%
Eurostat official data: Services 3.2% (from 3.4%), Food 2.7% (from 2.5%), Goods 0.4% (from 0.3%), Energy -4.1% (from -1.9%)
COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: WEEK'S DOMINANT MACRO EVENT - Inflation crashed through ECB 2% target to 1.7%, 30bp below consensus
Secondary signal: Core/super-core also fell (2.2% from 2.3%) - this is NOT just energy base effects, underlying inflation cooling
Noise: Methodological changes effective Feb 4 (COICOP reclassification, index rebase to 2025=100) add measurement uncertainty
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Creates easing optionality - headline below target gives political cover for cuts IF growth weakens, but ECB likely emphasizes services still 3.2% and holds for now
Transmission: Below-target inflation → real rates rising (restrictive stance tightening) → growth slowdown risk → eventual easing pressure
EURO ZONE — Producer Prices MM (Dec)

Actual: -0.3% vs Consensus: -0.3% vs Prior: +0.7% (revised from +0.5%)
YY: -2.1% vs Consensus: -2.3% vs Prior: -1.4% (revised from -1.7%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
PPI deflation (-2.1% YY) supports "pipeline disinflation intact" - margins absorbing costs, not passing through to CPI
ITALY — CPI Prelim YY (Jan)

Actual: 1.0% vs Consensus: 1.0% vs Prior: 1.2%

ITALY — CPI (EU Norm) Prelim YY (Jan)

Actual: 1.0% vs Consensus: 0.9% vs Prior: 1.2%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Italy disinflation continues (1.0% from 1.2%) - consistent with Zone-wide trend
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEDNESDAY 05 FEB — RELEASED
GERMANY — Industrial Orders MM (Dec)

Actual: +7.8% vs Consensus: -2.2% vs Prior: +5.7% (revised from +5.6%) — MASSIVE BEAT

GERMANY — Manufacturing Output Current Price SA (Dec)

Actual: 13.7% vs Prior: 11.0% (revised from 10.9%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: German orders surged 7.8% - reverses narrative of "manufacturing collapse"
Secondary signal: BUT data quality suspect - orders volatile, often revised heavily, and current price (13.7%) suggests nominal inflation distortion
Noise: HIGH - aircraft/defense orders can swing monthly data violently (see prior "unusual aircraft orders" warnings from analysts)
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Neutral - ECB likely discounts as volatile; needs production confirmation (which came negative on Friday -1.9%)
Transmission: Orders → production (2-3mo lag) - if real demand, supports capex/employment; if one-off, reverses quickly
FRANCE — Industrial Output MM (Dec)

Actual: -0.7% vs Consensus: +0.2% vs Prior: +0.1% (revised from -0.1%) — MAJOR MISS

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
French production contracted despite German orders surge - divergence raises questions about demand vs inventory dynamics
EURO ZONE — HCOB Construction PMI (Jan)

Actual: 45.3 vs Prior: 47.4 — deeper contraction

GERMANY — HCOB Construction PMI (Jan)

Actual: 44.7 vs Prior: 50.3 — fell into contraction

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Construction sector weakening (rate-sensitive) - housing still frozen despite ECB cuts
ITALY — Retail Sales MM (Dec)

Actual: -0.80% vs Prior: +0.50%

EURO ZONE — Retail Sales MM (Dec)

Actual: -0.5% vs Consensus: -0.2% vs Prior: +0.1% (revised from +0.2%) — MAJOR MISS
YY: +1.3% vs Consensus: +1.6% vs Prior: +2.4% (revised from +2.3%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Euro Zone consumption contracted in December (-0.5%) - challenges "domestic resilience" narrative from prior week
Secondary signal: YY deceleration (1.3% from 2.4% revised) shows momentum fading
Noise: December can be volatile (holiday timing)
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Dovish - consumption weakness + inflation undershoot = dual dovish signals
Transmission: Weak retail → services demand → services inflation cools further (validates HICP services drop to 3.2%)
ECB — Refinancing Rate (Feb decision)

Actual: 2.15% (HOLD) vs Consensus: 2.15%

ECB — Deposit Rate (Feb decision)

Actual: 2.00% (HOLD) vs Consensus: 2.00%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ ECB held as expected - fifth consecutive pause after cutting cycle ended
→ Market attention on Lagarde press conference - expected to stress "economy resilient but risks elevated" (Swedbank economist)
→ Consensus: ECB in "good place" but cautious - high bar for further action in either direction (BNP Paribas)
→ Debate: Next move cut or hike? Inflation below target argues cut, but services 3.2% + medium-term risks argue hold
COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Hold as expected - ECB in "wait and see" mode after HICP 1.7% undershoot
Secondary signal: Lagarde press conference tone matters more than decision - if emphasizes below-target inflation → dovish; if emphasizes services persistence → hawkish
Noise: Decision itself was 100% priced
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Baseline is extended pause - cuts contingent on growth deterioration OR services inflation sustainably <3%
Transmission: Holding at 2.00% deposit rate with inflation 1.7% = real rate ~+30bp (mildly restrictive) - not emergency tight, not accommodative
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THURSDAY 06 FEB — RELEASED
GERMANY — Industrial Production MM (Dec)

Actual: -1.9% vs Consensus: -0.3% vs Prior: +0.2% (revised from +0.8%) — MASSIVE MISS
YY: -0.55% vs Prior: +0.43% (revised from +0.76%)

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Majority view: Production collapsed in December - capital goods down 5.3%, intermediate goods down 1.2%, automotive down 8.9% (Destatis official, major analysts)
→ ING economist Carsten Brzeski: "Disappointed at end of year, but this is only a temporary halt, not a new downward trend"
→ Key concern: Contradicts Tuesday's massive orders beat (+7.8%) - raises data quality/timing mismatch questions
→ Sectoral breakdown: Automotive -8.9%, mechanical engineering -6.8%, maintenance/assembly -17.6% (deep contraction in core sectors)
→ Full year 2025: Manufacturing down 1.1% vs 2024 - confirms structural malaise
Destatis official: Capital goods production -5.3%, consumer goods +0.5%, intermediate goods -1.2%, energy -1.8%
COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: MAJOR NEGATIVE SURPRISE - German industrial production plunged 1.9% vs -0.3% expected, directly contradicting orders surge
Secondary signal: Sectoral detail matters - automotive/machinery (export-facing) collapsed, consumer goods held up → confirms "export drag, domestic resilience" split
Noise: Monthly IP highly volatile, BUT magnitude (-1.9% vs -0.3% consensus) and sectoral breadth (capital goods -5.3%) too large to dismiss
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Dovish - Germany is EA's largest economy; industrial weakness + retail sales drop + HICP undershoot = triple dovish combo
Transmission: IP → employment/capex (3-6mo lag) - if sustained, feeds into services weakness via income channel
ORDERS vs PRODUCTION DIVERGENCE (CRITICAL INTERPRETATION):

Wednesday: Orders +7.8% (huge beat)
Friday: Production -1.9% (huge miss)
HF take: Orders likely distorted by one-off aircraft/defense contracts (analysts flagged this risk); production is the real signal - German manufacturing still contracting

GERMANY — Exports MM SA (Dec)

Actual: +4.0% vs Consensus: +1.0% vs Prior: -2.5% — MAJOR BEAT

GERMANY — Imports MM SA (Dec)

Actual: +1.4% vs Consensus: +0.2% vs Prior: +0.7% (revised from +0.8%)

GERMANY — Trade Balance EUR SA (Dec)

Actual: 17.1B vs Consensus: 14.1B vs Prior: 13.6B (revised from 13.1B) — surplus widened

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Exports rebounded 4.0% - contradicts industrial production collapse (-1.9%)
Secondary signal: Data incoherence - how can exports surge while production plunges? Answer: Inventory drawdown OR timing mismatch (Dec exports from Nov/Oct production)
Noise: HIGH - trade data notoriously volatile month-to-month
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Confusing signal - disregard monthly noise, focus on trends (exports structurally weak, down 9% to US for full 2025 per earlier reports)
Transmission: If export strength is real → supports IP recovery in Jan/Feb; if inventory drawdown → IP weakness continues
SPAIN — Industrial Output YY (Dec)

Actual: -0.3% vs Prior: +4.6% (revised from +4.5%) — MAJOR REVERSAL

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Spanish production also weakened sharply - validates Zone-wide industrial slowdown
FRANCE — Trade Balance EUR SA (Dec)

Actual: -4.843B vs Prior: -4.036B (revised from -4.170B) — deficit widened

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
French trade deteriorating - export competitiveness erosion continues
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEEK SYNTHESIS — WHAT'S NEW / KEY NARRATIVE (DEEP-DIVE)
Comparison to prior week (Jan 26-30):
PRIOR WEEK REGIME: "Euro Area growth surprise to the upside (Q4 GDP 0.3%), domestic-demand cushioning while exports drag"
THIS WEEK: REGIME FORK - Inflation undershoot vs Growth softening
What actually changed:
1. INFLATION COLLAPSED (HICP 1.7% vs 2.0% consensus) - MAJOR PATTERN BREAK

Prior week: Inflation moderating gradually
This week: CRASHED through ECB 2% target to 1.7% (30bp below consensus)
NOT just energy - Core fell to 2.2% (lowest since Oct 2021), Services to 3.2% (from 3.4%)
HF take: This is the DOMINANT MACRO EVENT - gives ECB political cover for cuts IF growth weakens further

2. GROWTH SIGNALS DETERIORATING (multiple data points) - PATTERN ACCELERATION

Retail sales: -0.5% MM vs -0.2% consensus (consumption contracting)
German IP: -1.9% MM vs -0.3% consensus (manufacturing collapsing)
Services PMI: 51.6 from 51.9 (momentum slowing)
Spain services PMI: 53.5 from 57.1 (sharp deceleration)
Prior week narrative: "Domestic resilience" + Q4 GDP 0.3%
This week reality: Consumption contracting, production plunging, services slowing
HF take: Q4 GDP (+0.3%) was BACKWARD-LOOKING; real-time data shows Q1 2026 momentum fading

3. GERMANY DATA INCOHERENCE (orders vs production) - NOISE SPIKE

Wednesday: Orders +7.8% (massive beat)
Friday: Production -1.9% (massive miss)
Professional view: Orders likely distorted by aircraft/defense one-offs (ING, Haver Analytics)
HF take: Trust production over orders - IP is hard data, orders are survey-based and volatile

What did NOT change:

Manufacturing still in contraction (30 consecutive months <50 PMI) - structural, not cyclical
ECB held rates as expected (no surprise)
France still weakest major economy (services PMI 48.4, still contraction)

Regime assessment update:
PRIOR REGIME: "Domestic resilience cushions export drag"
UPDATED REGIME: "Inflation victory meets growth fragility - ECB in dovish fork"
The regime shift:

Week started with "resilience" narrative (prior Q4 GDP)
Week ended with "fragility" reality (retail -0.5%, IP -1.9%, HICP 1.7%)
ECB now faces: Below-target inflation (1.7%) + weakening growth → dovish bias rising

BUT: Services inflation still 3.2% (constraint) → ECB will hold for now, but cuts now more likely than hikes
Regime switch triggers (updated):
Dovish pivot (cuts resume):

Feb/Mar HICP confirms <1.8% + Services inflation <3.0% + Retail sales negative for 2 consecutive months → ECB cuts March/April

Hawkish hold (extended pause):

Services inflation re-accelerates >3.3% OR growth stabilizes (retail sales positive Feb) → ECB holds through Q2

Base case (65% probability): ECB holds Feb/Mar, cuts April/May as disinflation confirmed and growth weakness broadens
Cross-market implications:

EUR: Dovish pressure from inflation undershoot + growth weakness, but USD also weak (JOLTS 6.5M) → EUR/USD range-bound
Bunds: Rally (lower yields) on disinflation + growth concerns → curve steepening likely
Equities: Mixed - disinflation positive, but growth weakness negative for cyclicals

Next week's critical prints:

Germany February PMIs (Feb 20): Confirm IP collapse translates to sentiment/orders?
Euro Zone February services inflation breakdown (Feb 25): Does 3.2% continue to fall?
(ECB next decision March 5 - will have Feb HICP flash by then)

EURO AREA MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 26–30, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of Friday close
MODE: LIVE (HF sensitivity) — releases only, day-by-day
FOCUS: signal hierarchy • reaction function • transmission

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MONDAY 26 JAN — RELEASED
SPAIN — OVERNIGHT STAYS (DEC)

• 20,301,411 (prior 18,546,462)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: tourism momentum remains a key Spain growth pillar into year-end; this is consistent with Spain’s outperformance vs core.
Secondary: high seasonality/price effects matter — the direction supports domestic services resilience more than it changes Euro Area aggregate.
Noise: level prints are not the market’s primary Spain signal vs GDP/HICP.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): indirect only (Spain growth tail stronger, but policy set by EA-wide inflation/services).
Transmission: supports the “Spain carry” narrative; limited rates impact.

GERMANY — IFO (JAN)

• Business climate: 87.6 (consensus 88.2; prior 87.6) — miss
• Current conditions: 85.7 (consensus 86.0; prior 85.6)
• Expectations: 89.5 (consensus 90.3; prior 89.7) — miss

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Germany starts the year with little momentum — the headline flat + expectations down tells you the “recovery story” is still not self-sustaining.
Secondary: current conditions edging up is not nothing — it’s consistent with stabilization, but the miss in expectations is what matters for risk appetite.
Noise: Ifo isn’t a tradeable shock unless it confirms/contradicts the hard-data run-rate; here it confirms “slow grind.”
Reaction-function impact (ECB): marginally dovish on growth tails (Germany still fragile), but inflation is the binding constraint.
Transmission: modestly supportive for Bunds vs swaps; EUR-negative at the margin only if it clashes with broader EA resilience.

TUESDAY 27 JAN — RELEASED
FRANCE — CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (JAN)

• 90 (consensus 90; prior 90)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: no change — France households remain stuck in “cautious plateau.”
Secondary: consistent with a saving bias and weak discretionary impulse.
Noise: limited market salience.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none.
Transmission: none.

SPAIN — UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (Q4)

• 9.93% (consensus 10.20; prior 10.45) — better

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Spain labor market continues to improve — reinforces the “Spain engine” story (services + employment).
Secondary: tighter labor can slow disinflation locally, but Spain’s inflation pulse has already cooled from earlier highs.
Noise: quarterlies can be lumpy; direction remains constructive.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none direct; contributes to “EA resilience” narrative.
Transmission: supports Spain risk/credit; limited rates impact.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEDNESDAY 28 JAN — RELEASED
GERMANY — GfK CONSUMER SENTIMENT (FEB)

• -24.1 (consensus -26.0; prior -26.9) — better

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: German households are less pessimistic — disinflation + wages are finally easing the drag, but the level remains recessionary in spirit.
Secondary: this is consistent with the week’s “domestic demand cushioning exports” narrative (see Fri GDP tape).
Noise: sentiment improves faster than spending; the bridge is confidence-to-credit-to-consumption.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): mildly less dovish on growth tail, but still not inflation-relevant.
Transmission: modestly risk-supportive; helps explain resilience in activity prints.

ITALY — CONFIDENCE (JAN)

• Manufacturing confidence: 89.2 (consensus 89.0; prior 88.4)
• Consumer confidence: 96.8 (consensus 97.0; prior 96.6)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Italy is steady-to-better on sentiment — no acceleration, but no new stress.
Secondary: consistent with “slow recovery / low trend” rather than any break-out.
Noise: market ignores these unless they foreshadow hard-data turning points.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none.
Transmission: none.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THURSDAY 29 JAN — RELEASED
SPAIN — RETAIL SALES y/y (DEC)

• 6.0% (prior 2.9%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Spain demand strength is real — strong consumption into year-end.
Secondary: watch for base effects/price effects; but the magnitude reinforces that Spain’s domestic story is not fading.
Noise: retail can be volatile and category-driven.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none direct; adds to “EA domestic demand resilience” via Spain weight at the margin.
Transmission: Spain assets supportive; little rates reaction.

EURO AREA — MONETARY / CREDIT (DEC)

• M3 y/y: 2.8% (consensus 3.0; prior 3.0) — softer
• Loans to households y/y: 2.9% (prior 3.0)
• Loans to non-financials y/y: 3.1% (prior 3.0)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: broad liquidity impulse is not re-accelerating — M3 softens, consistent with still-restrictive policy transmission.
Secondary: credit is not collapsing (HH + NFC lending still positive), which fits the “no hard landing” tone.
Noise: monthly money numbers can be distorted by portfolio shifts; trend matters.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): supports staying on hold — policy is restrictive enough to keep monetary impulse contained.
Transmission: mild support for front-end rates (less hawkish tail); limited FX effect.

ITALY — NON-EU TRADE BALANCE (DEC)

• €8.39bn (prior €6.92bn)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: external balance improves — helps cushion growth at the margin.
Secondary: partner mix matters; market cares only if it changes GDP tracking materially.
Noise: volatile.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none.
Transmission: none.

EURO AREA — EC SURVEYS (JAN)

• Economic sentiment (ESI): 99.4 (consensus 97.0; prior 96.7) — large upside
• Industrial sentiment: -6.8 (consensus -8.1; prior -9.0) — improves
• Services sentiment: 7.2 (consensus 6.0; prior 5.6) — improves
• Business climate: -0.56 (prior -0.41)
• Consumer confidence final: -12.4 (in line; unchanged)
• Consumer inflation expectations: 26.7 (prior 24.1)
• Selling price expectations: 10.9 (prior 10.0; prior revised 10.8)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: broad-based sentiment rebound — the economy enters 2026 with better tone, especially services; that’s consistent with the “resilience” narrative.
Secondary: the inflation expectations and selling price expectations tick higher — this is the subtle hawkish detail desks watch (services pricing power vs disinflation comfort).
Noise: survey levels can mean-revert; focus is on persistence and confirmation in PMIs/hard data.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): two-handed — better growth tone reduces easing tail, but higher price expectations keep the ECB cautious about declaring victory on services inflation.
Transmission: risk-supportive; rates impact ambiguous (growth up vs inflation-risk tails up); EUR mildly supported on “EA not rolling over,” unless inflation tails dominate.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FRIDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED
FRANCE (DEC / Q4)

• Consumer spending m/m (Dec): -0.4% (consensus -0.4; prior -0.6)
• GDP q/q (Q4 prelim): 0.2% (consensus 0.2; prior 0.5)
• GDP y/y (Q4 prelim): 1.1% (consensus 1.2; prior 0.9) — slight miss

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: France slows from Q3 but stays positive — domestic demand isn’t collapsing, but momentum is clearly lower.
Secondary: spending is still soft; France is not a demand locomotive for the zone.
Noise: prelim GDP composition/revisions can change the message; the level is “ok, not great.”
Reaction-function impact (ECB): neutral; France is not the constraint.
Transmission: limited.

GERMANY (DEC / Q4 / JAN)

• Import prices m/m (Dec): -0.4% (consensus -0.1; prior 0.5)
• Import prices y/y (Dec): -2.6% (consensus -2.3; prior -1.9)
• Unemployment change SA (Jan): 0k (consensus 4k; prior 3k)
• Unemployment rate SA (Jan): 6.3% (consensus 6.3; prior 6.3)
• GDP q/q (Q4 flash SA): 0.3% (consensus 0.2; prior 0.0) — upside
• GDP y/y (Q4 flash NSA): 0.6% (consensus 0.3; prior 0.3) — upside

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Germany beats on Q4 growth while disinflation continues through import prices — a “better growth / benign price” combo that supports the soft-landing narrative.
Secondary: labor is flat, not deteriorating — consistent with stabilization rather than renewed stress.
Noise: flash GDP can be revised; the key is whether domestic demand is carrying vs inventories/net exports.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): marginally less dovish on growth tails, but import prices keep the inflation impulse soft — net effect still “ECB can stay patient.”
Transmission: supports Bund risk sentiment; EUR mildly supported via growth surprise, but muted if markets focus on disinflation.

ITALY (Q4 / DEC / LABOR)

• GDP q/q (Q4 prelim): 0.3% (consensus 0.2; prior 0.1) — upside
• GDP y/y (Q4 prelim): 0.8% (consensus 0.5; prior 0.6) — upside
• Unemployment rate (Dec): 5.6% (consensus 5.8; prior 5.7) — better
• PPI m/m (Dec): -0.7% (prior 1.0)
• PPI y/y (Dec): -1.4% (prior -0.2)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Italy surprises stronger on growth and better on unemployment, while producer prices turn down — reinforces “growth ok, inflation not a problem.”
Secondary: sustainability question remains (Italy cycle is sensitive to financing conditions and external demand).
Noise: GDP prelims can revise; focus on domestic demand momentum.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): supports hold; keeps periphery spreads contained.
Transmission: BTP supportive; little EUR-wide rates impact.

SPAIN (Q4 / JAN INFLATION / EXTERNAL)

• GDP q/q (Q4 est): 0.8% (consensus 0.6; prior 0.6) — upside
• GDP y/y (Q4 est): 2.6% (consensus 2.7; prior 2.8) — slight miss
• HICP y/y (Jan flash): 2.5% (consensus 2.4; prior 3.0) — small upside vs cons, big down vs prior
• HICP m/m (Jan flash): -0.7% (consensus -0.8; prior 0.3)
• Spain current account (Nov): €7.18bn (prior €0.21bn)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Spain remains the growth engine of the bloc (big Q4 beat) while inflation is cooling sharply from prior levels — that’s the best mix for risk.
Secondary: the small upside vs consensus on Jan HICP is not the story; the story is the downshift from 3.0% → 2.5%.
Noise: flash inflation can revise; seasonal m/m is always noisy.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): Spain no longer a near-term inflation problem; stronger growth reinforces resilience but doesn’t force policy.
Transmission: supports Spain assets; helps the “EA growth better than feared” narrative.

EURO AREA (Q4 / LABOR)

• GDP q/q (Q4 flash prelim): 0.3% (consensus 0.2; prior 0.3) — upside
• GDP y/y (Q4 flash prelim): 1.3% (consensus 1.2; prior 1.4) — upside
• Unemployment rate (Dec): 6.2% (consensus 6.3; prior 6.3) — better

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: resilience confirmed — the zone ends 2025 on a firmer footing than priced, with domestic demand offsetting export weakness.
Secondary: the unemployment down-tick matters — it supports the “no hard landing” baseline and keeps consumption from breaking.
Noise: flash GDP can revise; but cross-country profile (Spain strong; Germany/Italy better; France ok) is coherent.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): strengthens the “hold” case — not enough weakness to force easing, and with inflation near target the ECB can stay patient.
Transmission: reduces tail-risk hedging demand; keeps front-end anchored; modestly EUR-supportive on growth surprise, but capped by disinflation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK SYNTHESIS — WHAT’S NEW / KEY NARRATIVE (DEEP-DIVE)

The week’s true macro pivot
• Euro Area growth surprise to the upside (Q4 GDP 0.3% vs 0.2 expected) alongside lower unemployment (6.2%) cements the “EA resilience” narrative into early 2026.
• This is not an export-led story — it’s domestic-demand cushioning while exports remain the structural drag.

Germany: “stabilising, not accelerating”
• Ifo missed and says “little momentum,” but Q4 GDP beat and labor held flat.
• Net message: Germany is no longer collapsing, but sentiment is not pricing a clean recovery path — hard data is better than the tone.

Spain: the engine, but now with disinflation
• Spain prints are the cleanest “good news”: strong activity (Q4 beat, retail strong, unemployment down) and inflation cooling sharply.
• This matters for the EA narrative because it supports growth without importing ECB hawkishness.

Inflation / price pressure: the subtle risk
• Monetary data (M3) remains contained; import prices in Germany are disinflationary; PPIs soft.
• But EC survey inflation expectations and selling price expectations rose — this is the “don’t get complacent on services inflation” tell.

Reaction-function takeaway (ECB)
• Net: ECB hold reinforced. Growth is too resilient to force dovish urgency, while price indicators keep the ECB cautious on services inflation.

France
• Mfg: 51.0 | Services: 47.9 | Composite: 48.6

Germany
• Mfg: 48.7 | Services: 53.3 | Composite: 52.5

Euro Area
• Mfg: 49.4 | Services: 51.9 | Composite: 51.5

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: widening dispersion and services slowdown — EA remains in expansion, but growth momentum is less clean.
Secondary: France emerges as the weak link; Germany holds via services.
Key nuance: PMI price components firm, keeping services-inflation risk alive despite benign headline CPI.
Reaction function (ECB): reinforces wait-and-see; inflation near target but not “won”.
Transmission: mixed risk; rates anchored, equities trade dispersion.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEEK SYNTHESIS — WHAT’S NEW / NARRATIVE

What changed this week
• Headline inflation decisively below target (1.9%) — strongest anchor for the ECB hold narrative.
• Goods disinflation reconfirmed via German PPI.
• Growth remains positive but uneven; PMI services lose momentum.
• Germany sentiment improves sharply, strengthening the “improvement ahead” story.

HF framing
The market narrative is now a three-way tension:

Inflation behaving (headline <2, core stable)

Growth positive but fragile and dispersed

Services price pressure preventing a full dovish pivot

What would flip the story
• Actual services inflation re-accelerating → hawkish tails reopen
• France weakness spreading to orders/employment → growth downside rises
• Persistent CA compression → marginal EUR headwind

EUR Macro Note — HF Live Run
Date: 18 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 5 Jan 2026 – 16 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & reaction-function context): past ~1 month

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (still soft-landing / low-trend, but with a cleaner inflation anchor and a more visible “external tails” layer):
Euro area remains a two-speed regime: services keep activity above stall while manufacturing is still structurally weak. The ECB remains on a restrictive plateau with high optionality, and the binding constraint remains underlying/services inflation + wages — but the “headline at/near 2” anchor has strengthened.

What is NEW in the primary window (5–16 Jan):

The inflation anchor improved in a way that is marketable (headline inflation at ~2.0% in Dec), but professional desks did not read this as “all-clear”: the focus stayed on the composition (core/services/wages), and on policy staying restrictive even as headline converges.

Survey momentum turned meaningfully less negative (Sentix jump), consistent with “stabilisation not rebound” — i.e., confidence/expectations improving while the hard-data ceiling remains.

Hard data confirmed a modest industrial stabilisation in November (industrial production rose again m/m), but the profile still looks like “bounce at low levels,” not a manufacturing-led recovery.

External tail risks gained salience in the ECB narrative layer: US political interference with the Fed was explicitly framed by ECB officials as a global stability risk; add the usual euro-area external risks (China trade pressure; tariff risks).

France-specific policy/budget uncertainty remained a second-order growth drag and risk-premium tail, with ECB/BoF voices explicitly warning about deficit discipline and the confidence cost.

What did NOT change:

Services are still the stabiliser; manufacturing remains the drag.

The ECB’s reaction function remains “hold on plateau until underlying inflation / wages are convincingly consistent with 2%.” Headline convergence is necessary but not sufficient.

The regime’s convexity is still spillover: if the goods weakness leaks into labour/services, the ECB can pivot dovish quickly; if services inflation persists, the plateau extends.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: a clear deterioration in euro-area labour/services demand (employment components, unemployment trend, negotiated wage cooling) alongside core/services inflation momentum rolling decisively lower.

Hawkish tail trigger: services inflation persistence / wage transmission stalls, forcing “hold longer” even with headline near 2%; the “next move hike tail” stays a tail but becomes less dismissible if services persistence reasserts.

External-shock trigger: tariff/trade shocks or financial stability stress (including a USD-volatility episode) tighten financial conditions and force ECB risk-management dovishness despite inflation progress.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

15 Jan 2026 – Euro area Industrial Production (Nov, Eurostat first estimate)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: +0.7% m/m (euro area); prior month also positive
Y/Y: +2.5% y/y
Signal (composition + “what pros highlighted”): a second consecutive monthly gain supports a “hard-data floor,” but the broader manufacturing complex still looks structurally constrained; professionals treat it as stabilisation from depressed levels rather than a new cycle.
HF take: helps keep the soft-landing base case intact and reduces near-term recession risk; not enough to change the ECB constraint (services/wages). The key is whether this stabilisation spreads to orders/capex and survives external demand headwinds.

15 Jan 2026 – Euro area International Trade in Goods (Nov, first estimate)
Actual / Prior: surplus around €9.9bn (narrower than a year earlier)
Signal: the euro area continues to run a surplus, but the magnitude is smaller; the professional read stays “trade is not the growth engine,” and the manufacturing/export channel remains vulnerable to external shocks and relative price competitiveness.
HF take: reinforces the two-speed framing. Trade is an important tail-risk conduit (tariffs/China dumping), not the base-case driver of a rebound.

12 Jan 2026 – Euro area Sentix Investor Confidence (Jan)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: -1.8 / -4.9 / -6.2
Signal: sharp improvement in expectations; current conditions still negative but improving.
HF take: the market-relevant point is not “Sentix up” but “expectations turning”: it supports a better growth distribution (fewer left-tail recession odds) while leaving the ceiling low because hard data and manufacturing remain constrained.

9 Jan 2026 – Euro area Retail Trade Volume (Nov, Eurostat first estimate)
Actual / Prior: +0.2% m/m; prior month +0.3% m/m
Y/Y: +2.3% y/y (calendar-adjusted)
Signal: consumer activity is not collapsing; small positive sequential gains consistent with soft-landing consumption dynamics rather than a demand relapse.
HF take: supports the “services/consumption floor.” Not strong enough to reprice the ECB; the question remains whether wage-driven disinflation proceeds without requiring a demand shock.

8 Jan 2026 – Euro area Unemployment Rate (Nov, Eurostat)
Actual / Prior: 6.3% / 6.4%
Signal: marginal improvement m/m, but still slightly higher than a year ago; labour market remains supportive but not tightening further.
HF take: consistent with “slowdown without break.” The ECB needs wage/negotiated wage evidence more than one unemployment print; still, this reduces near-term downside urgency.

7 Jan 2026 – Euro area HICP Flash Estimate (Dec, Eurostat)
Actual / Consensus / Prior: 2.0% y/y / ~2.0 / 2.1
Signal: headline inflation at target is a powerful narrative anchor, but professionals immediately move to “what about core/services/wages?” rather than declaring victory.
HF take: strengthens the case for the ECB holding rather than tightening; does not automatically pull forward easing. The plateau remains justified as long as underlying inflation is not fully “2-consistent.”

6 Jan 2026 – Eurozone PMI (Dec, survey)
Signal: growth slowed in December but Q4 ended as the strongest quarter since 2023; services offset manufacturing contraction.
HF take: reinforces the regime: services floor + manufacturing drag. For markets, the important element is that activity is expanding, which makes “imminent ECB easing” harder to justify absent clearer services disinflation or labour rollover.

Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE (macro desks / institutional / HF-followed public commentary — synthesized)

“Stabilisation is real, rebound is not.”

“Inflation is converging, but the last mile is services/wages.”

“ECB is on hold through 2026 in baseline; tails are (i) services persistence (hawkish plateau) vs (ii) spillover into labour/services (dovish pivot).”

“External shocks dominate the tail-risk map: tariffs, China trade pressure, and episodic financial stability stress.”

“France fiscal uncertainty is a risk-premium channel, not yet a macro print driver.”

EVIDENCE MAP (anchored to Section 2)
Activity:

PMI narrative: services keep expansion while manufacturing drags (6 Jan).

Hard data supports a floor: industrial production +0.7% m/m (15 Jan).
Demand:

Retail volumes modestly positive (9 Jan) → consumption floor.
External:

Trade surplus persists but narrower; external channel remains vulnerability (15 Jan).
Prices:

Headline HICP at ~2.0 (7 Jan) → narrative improvement; still not sufficient to relax ECB constraint without underlying confirmation.
Labour:

Unemployment down to 6.3% (8 Jan) → no labour break yet; the “wages/negotiated wages” channel remains the decisive input.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)
The euro area is in a stable-but-low-ceiling equilibrium: services and consumption prevent a downturn while manufacturing and external demand cap upside. Inflation convergence gives the ECB room to stay on hold without tightening credibility stress, but it does not force easing because the binding constraint remains services/wages. The convexity remains spillover: if goods weakness transmits into labour/services, the ECB’s reaction function flips dovish fast; if not, plateau persists.

BINDING CONSTRAINT + next print that matters
Binding constraint: services inflation persistence / wage transmission (negotiated wage dynamics).
Next prints that matter: any clean update on underlying inflation momentum (especially services) and wage indicators, plus services employment signals that would confirm/deny spillover.

Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections (MANDATORY)
ECB Governing Council – 17–18 Dec 2025
Policy decision: HOLD (Deposit facility rate 2.00%)
Reaction-function anchor: restrictive plateau; data-dependent; emphasis on underlying inflation and wage dynamics; manufacturing weakness treated as tail unless spillover emerges.

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)
Villeroy de Galhau – 14 Jan 2026

Core message: France risks a “danger zone” if fiscal deficit exceeds ~5% in 2026; political uncertainty has a measurable growth cost.

Bias: financial-stability / risk-premium aware (macro-fiscal discipline).

Adds/changes: elevates the France fiscal channel as a near-term confidence/risk-premium tail rather than a slow-moving background story.

Kazaks – 15 Jan 2026

Core message: no room for complacency; attacks on Fed independence are a global risk; inflation trend in euro area improving; rates currently appropriate.

Bias: hold with vigilance (risk management; institutional independence).

Adds/changes: explicitly links US institutional risk to global inflation/rates risk; reinforces ECB preference to remain “steady and credible.”

de Guindos – 15 Jan 2026 (Politico interview)

Core message: ECB–Fed cooperation “business as usual”; swap lines support stability; ECB has advised banks to bolster liquidity/capital against potential USD volatility; independence matters.

Bias: stability-focused; hold/plateau compatible.

Adds/changes: underlines financial stability plumbing as a live tail-risk consideration (USD volatility / dollar funding) even in a benign base case.

Mandatory HF synthesis (reaction-function snapshot)
Base case: ECB stays on a restrictive plateau; headline inflation at target reduces tightening risk but does not force easing. Communication focus has broadened: in addition to services/wages, policymakers are explicitly attentive to global institutional/financial stability tails (USD volatility, central bank independence risks) that could tighten conditions without domestic data deterioration.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Primary window: France budget/fiscal uncertainty remains unresolved enough to matter for confidence and risk premia; it is discussed explicitly by BoF/ECB voices as a credibility issue.
Transmission: risk premium → financial conditions → investment/hiring at the margin; spillover risk into services confidence.

Rolling (last ~1M): external policy risks (tariffs, China trade pressure) remain key tails that hit the euro area primarily through manufacturing and trade rather than domestic demand.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (macro-driven)
Front-end: anchored by “headline inflation at target + ECB plateau.” The sensitivity remains highest to services inflation/wage evidence, not to headline.
Curve/term premium: capped by low-trend growth; steepening risk is more “services persistence” than “growth rebound.”
Key asymmetry: downside data/spillover → dovish repricing can happen quickly; upside surprises mainly extend the plateau rather than restart hikes.

EUR (relative by construction)
Support: inflation convergence plus ECB plateau; soft-landing floor improves EUR downside protection in risk-on conditions.
Drag: external tail risks (trade/tariffs/China) and episodic risk-premium shocks (France fiscal politics; global USD-volatility channel).
EUR trigger map:
• EUR-positive: services inflation persistence keeps ECB plateau longer without growth accident (relative rates support).
• EUR-negative: labour/services rollover + faster underlying disinflation → earlier easing optionality.

====================================================

MONDAY 12 JAN — RELEASED

EURO AREA SENTIX INDEX (JAN)

Sentix: -1.8 (consensus -4.9; prior -6.2)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: sentiment is still negative but the improvement is material — the “recession mood” is fading at the margin.
Secondary: Sentix tends to lead risk tone more than hard activity; the market treats it as confirmation of “soft landing / shallow cycle,” not a growth trigger.
Noise: survey volatility is high; a single print rarely reprices ECB.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): neutral-to-mildly hawkish at the margin on growth tails (less downside), but not inflation-relevant.
Transmission: small risk-supportive impulse (equities/credit) if corroborated by hard data; limited rates impact.

FRANCE BUDGET BALANCE (NOV)

Budget balance: -155.41B (prior -136.17B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: deterioration vs prior month level; more about seasonality/execution than regime shift.
Secondary: fiscal impulse relevance is 2026 stance (spending pickup / restraint) — this monthly line does not settle it.
Noise: high seasonality/accounting effects; market impact typically minimal.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none near-term.
Transmission: negligible; only matters if it feeds a broader fiscal narrative later.

FRANCE CPI (EU NORM / HICP) FINAL (DEC)

HICP m/m: 0.1% (consensus 0.1; prior 0.1)
HICP y/y: 0.7% (consensus 0.7; prior 0.7)

France CPI y/y (NSA): 0.8% (consensus 0.8; prior 0.8)
France CPI m/m (NSA): 0.1% (consensus 0.1; prior 0.1)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: final confirms the flash — no revision risk, no inflation surprise.
Secondary: keeps France as a low-inflation anchor; not the ECB constraint.
Noise: none (all in line).
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none incremental.
Transmission: none.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (France inflation framing)
French headline disinflation continues; services broadly sideways; core ~stable. (Confirmation only; no change to market signal.)

SPAIN CPI / HICP FINAL (DEC)

CPI m/m (NSA): 0.3% (consensus 0.3; prior 0.3)
CPI y/y (NSA): 2.9% (consensus 2.9; prior 2.9)
HICP m/m: 0.3% (consensus 0.3; prior 0.3)
HICP y/y: 3.0% (consensus 3.0; prior 3.0)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: Spain remains the inflation outlier inside EA, but finals are non-events (no revision).
Secondary: reinforces dispersion: Spain inflation > EA core trend, but policy set by EA aggregate.
Noise: none.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none incremental.
Transmission: none.

GERMANY WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX (DEC)

WPI m/m: 0.3% (consensus -0.2)
WPI y/y: 1.5% (consensus 1.2)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: pipeline inflation firmer than expected at wholesale level — but pass-through to CPI is unstable.
Secondary: becomes relevant only if echoed in PPI/import prices and if goods disinflation stalls.
Noise: commodity/base effects can dominate.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): minimal unless it changes the goods disinflation path.
Transmission: marginal upward pressure on goods-inflation tails; limited market impact by itself.

GERMANY FULL YEAR GDP (2025)

GDP: 0.2% (consensus 0.2; prior -0.2)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: stabilisation, not recovery — confirms Germany is weakly positive vs last year’s contraction, but still low trend.
Secondary: composition matters (consumption vs investment/exports) for 2026 momentum and for the “Germany engine restarts” narrative.
Noise: annual print; markets trade Q4/Q1 run-rate and fiscal follow-through more than full-year GDP.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): slightly reduces hard-landing tail; does not shift inflation constraint.
Transmission: modestly supportive for EUR growth narrative only if matched by near-term acceleration.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (Germany GDP details)
Real GDP: +0.3% y/y (calendar-adjusted) in 2025; +0.2% y/y (non-calendar-adjusted). Better than 2023 (-0.7%) and 2024 (-0.5%). Household consumption: +1.4% y/y. Exports and investment contracted; manufacturing GVA: -1.3% y/y (autos, machinery, energy-intensive led). Fiscal stance: no stimulus in 2025; deficit narrowed from 2.7% of GDP (2024) to 2.4% (2025). Interpretation: fiscal support did not materialize in 2025; 2026 spending likely slower than consensus; industrial headwinds cap recovery.

ITALY INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT (NOV)

m/m SA: 1.5% (consensus 0.5; prior -1.0)
y/y WDA: 1.4% (consensus -0.6; prior -0.3)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: very strong upside surprise — hard data outperforms surveys again.
Secondary: breadth matters; if broad-based it supports Q4 carry-over and reduces recession tail.
Noise: high monthly volatility; one print doesn’t erase the weak trend.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): supportive on growth tails, but subordinate to inflation path.
Transmission: supports risk and BTP beta at the margin; limited EUR rates impact unless replicated across EA.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (Italy IP detail)
Sector: energy +3.9%; capital goods +2.1%; consumer goods +1.1%; intermediate +0.1%. Carry-over: ~+1.0% q/q for Q4 if Dec flat. Surveys weakened in Dec; realised output has outperformed survey signals. Interpretation: positive Q4 GDP contribution; surveys flag downside but lag hard data.

EURO AREA INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (NOV)

m/m: 0.7% (consensus 0.5; prior 0.8)
y/y: 2.5% (consensus 2.0; prior 2.0)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: manufacturing momentum into mid-Q4 firmer than expected — upside vs consensus.
Secondary: sector mix is the key (capital goods strength vs durables weakness).
Noise: IP is volatile; the market will fade it if PMIs soften further.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): mildly reduces downside growth tail; not inflation-relevant.
Transmission: supports cyclical risk tone; modest support for EUR growth narrative if sustained.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (EZ IP & sector mix)
Country mix: strength in Germany/Spain/Italy; small decline in France. Sector: capital goods +3.6% m/m; intermediate +1.1%; durable -2.1%; non-durables +3.4%; energy +0.5%. Carry-over: ~+1.0% for Q4 assuming flat Dec. Interpretation: supports Q4 GDP upside; surveys suggest December dip risk.

EURO AREA TRADE BALANCE (NOV)

Trade balance SA: 10.70B (prior 14.00B; prior revised 13.70B)
Eurostat trade NSA: 9.9B (prior 18.4B; prior revised 17.9B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: surplus narrower — external contribution less supportive than prior month.
Secondary: whether import strength is demand-led (good) vs price-led (less informative) is the key read-through.
Noise: NSA vs SA differences + revisions can be material.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none direct; only matters via GDP tracking.
Transmission: marginally softens EUR external-support narrative.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (external accounts framing)
Imports +2.5% m/m; exports +1.1% m/m in Nov (user note). Net trade likely marginal positive for Q4 goods after flat Q3 and sharp drag in Q2 (user note framing).

ITALY TRADE (NOV)

Trade balance EU: -1.959B (prior -1.310B; prior revised -1.283B)
Global trade balance: 5.078B (prior 4.156B; prior revised 4.183B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: EU balance weaker; global balance still solid — partner-mix effects dominate.
Secondary: relevance is low unless it links to growth or spreads.
Noise: month-to-month partner volatility.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none.
Transmission: negligible.

LSEG IPSOS PCSI (JAN)

Germany: 46.35 (prior 46.44)
France: 39.77 (prior 40.46)
Italy: 47.69 (prior 45.86)
Spain: 49.23 (prior 49.54)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: levels remain subdued; France notably weak; Italy improved.
Secondary: useful cross-check for “two-speed EA” and consumer caution.
Noise: small moves; low market salience.
Reaction-function impact (ECB): none near-term.
Transmission: none.

INTEGRATION — USER NOTE (households / saving constraint)
Eurozone household saving rate remains elevated (15.1% in Q3 vs 15.4% Q2; well above 2010s average ~12.5%), reflecting precautionary saving and uncertainty — implies consumption normalises slowly and caps upside growth. (Structural context; not a weekly catalyst.)

Headline CPI 1.8% y/y; HICP 2.0% y/y. Core (national CPI) 2.4% y/y; core (HICP) 2.5% y/y. Goods inflation 0.4% y/y (from 1.1%); services steady at 3.5% (services ex-rents eased to 4.0%). Energy -1.3%; food 0.8%. Drivers: abolition of gas storage levy and grid-fee subsidies reduced household energy/electricity prices. Interpretation: near-term risk skews dovish if January confirms broad disinflation; services is the holdout.

<<<EUR_MACRO_NOTE_BEGIN>>>
🇪🇺 EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 4 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 19 Dec 2025 – 2 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & reaction-function context): past ~1 month

====================================================

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information
====================================================

Macro regime (unchanged):
Euro area remains in a low-trend / soft-landing regime: services-led expansion, persistent manufacturing drag, inflation converging toward target, and the ECB holding a restrictive plateau with high optionality.

What is NEW in the primary window (19 Dec – 2 Jan):

The cycle split sharpened: hard data and ECB projections support a “growth floor”, but manufacturing momentum deteriorated into year-end (final PMI revised down, orders/export orders weakening).

ECB’s latest decision remains the regime anchor (18 Dec): rates held, projections revised to firmer near-term growth and slower services disinflation, reinforcing “hold for longer” and legitimising the market debate around late-2026 hikes (timing, not direction).

Professional narrative deep-search outcome (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources): the dominant read is “stabilisation, not rebound; services inflation persistence is the constraint; manufacturing weakness is a tail risk unless it spills into labour/services.” The key nuance professionals emphasise is composition + revisions, not the headline levels.

What did NOT change:

The ECB’s binding constraint is still underlying/services inflation and wage transmission, not headline volatility.

Manufacturing remains a drag but not yet a regime-breaker absent labour spillover.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Hawkish tail: services inflation fails to cool / wages decelerate less than projected → plateau extends; front-end reprices “higher for longer”.

Dovish tail: services demand/employment components roll over + clearer wage deceleration + core momentum drops → ECB can pivot toward easing optionality faster.

====================================================
2) Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Fri 2 Jan 2026 – Euro area Manufacturing PMI (Dec, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

PMI: 48.8 / 49.2 (prelim) / 49.6 (Nov)
Signal (surprise + momentum + “what pros highlighted”):

Downward revision versus prelim and clear sequential weakening versus Nov; the professional focus is on the orders complex (new + export orders) and the fact that production slipped back into contraction.
HF take:

Keeps the growth distribution skewed left even in a soft-landing regime; it’s not just “below 50”, it’s worsening breadth.

ECB implication: by itself, this does not force dovishness; it raises the spillover question (when/if weak goods demand transmits into services employment and wage bargaining).

Thu 18 Dec 2025 – ECB policy decision + staff projections (Governing Council)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Deposit rate: 2.00% (HOLD) / HOLD / 2.00%

Staff projections (selected, averages):
• Headline HICP: 2025 2.1 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.8 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
• HICP ex energy & food: 2025 2.4 / n/a / n/a ; 2026 2.2 / n/a / n/a ; 2027 1.9 / n/a / n/a ; 2028 2.0 / n/a / n/a
Signal (what changed vs the prior framework):

Inflation revised up for 2026 mainly because services inflation is expected to decline more slowly; growth expected to be stronger than September projections, driven especially by domestic demand.
HF take:

This is the reaction-function anchor: “plateau + confirmation” is reinforced; cuts are not mechanically imminent.

The market’s late-2026 hike chatter is best read as a services-persistence tail being priced, not a base case of re-acceleration.

Wed 17 Dec 2025 – Euro area HICP (Nov, final)
Actual / Consensus / Prior:

Headline y/y: 2.1 / n/a (final prints typically not separately surveyed; prelim consensus was ~2.1) / 2.1 (Oct)

Core y/y: 2.4 / n/a (same convention as above) / 2.4 (Oct)

Services y/y: 3.5 / n/a / 3.4 (Oct)
Signal (composition + “what pros highlighted”):

The non-obvious focus is services inflation re-accelerating at the margin (even while headline sits near target), consistent with the ECB’s projection change (slower services disinflation).
HF take:

This print is consistent with “near-target headline”, but it tightens the constraint on easing optionality: services/wages must do the disinflation work.

The risk is not a headline re-acceleration; it’s persistence that keeps policy restrictive longer than a naïve “headline ≈ 2%” read implies.

Context / regime anchors from this execution chat (treated as anchors; fully integrated):

Euro area Industrial Production (Oct; published 15 Dec): +0.8% m/m; prior +0.2% m/m.

Euro area Trade (Oct; published 16 Dec): trade surplus improved vs 3Q average; pros emphasise lower imports and intra-Europe support.

Germany Industrial Production (Oct; published 8 Dec): +1.8% m/m vs +0.4% expected; pros treat it as stabilisation, not recovery (construction boost + still weak three-month trend).

Country inflation finals (Nov): Germany HICP 2.6% y/y; Spain ~3.0–3.1% y/y; Italy HICP ~1.1% y/y; France CPI ex-tobacco modest m/m gains.

====================================================
3) Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE (asset managers / macro desks / HF-followed public sources)

Base case: stabilisation, not rebound; growth floor intact but weak, with limited upside torque.

Key debate: services inflation persistence vs wage moderation — how quickly does underlying inflation converge once energy/base effects fade?

Tail 1 (hawkish): services persistence + resilient domestic demand → plateau extends; late-2026 hike tail gets fatter.

Tail 2 (dovish): manufacturing drag spills into labour/services → earlier easing optionality returns.

EVIDENCE MAP (explicitly tied to Section 2 + chat anchors)
Activity:

Oct IP +0.8% m/m (anchor) supports stabilisation; but Dec manufacturing PMI 48.8 (2 Jan) shows renewed goods weakness and worsening orders → caps upside and increases spillover risk.
Demand:

ECB projections (18 Dec) cite stronger domestic-demand support vs Sep → consistent with services resilience; manufacturing orders contradict a broad demand re-acceleration.
Prices:

HICP headline stable at 2.1 but services 3.5 (17 Dec) + ECB projection change (slower services disinflation) → the inflation constraint is concentrated in services/wages, not headline.
Financial conditions / risk premium:

Manufacturing deterioration primarily transmits via risk premium and corporate caution (capex/hiring), unless confirmed by labour/service indicators.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)

The euro area is in a two-speed regime: services resilience is the stabiliser; manufacturing/export demand is the drag.

The ECB’s constraint is not “where headline is today”, it is whether services inflation decelerates durably as wages cool.

The key convexity is spillover: if manufacturing weakness remains contained, the ECB can hold; if it spills into labour/services, the reaction function shifts dovish quickly.

BINDING CONSTRAINT + next print that matters

Binding constraint: services inflation persistence / wage transmission.

Next print that matters: any reliable update on services inflation momentum, wage/negotiated wage indicators, and services employment (i.e., evidence that services disinflation is accelerating or stalling).

Rolling regime assessment: CONFIRMS soft-landing / low-trend, with (i) manufacturing downside tail and (ii) services-inflation persistence tail.

4) Central Bank Speaker Tape (rolling 1M)

Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections (MANDATORY)
ECB Governing Council – 18 Dec 2025

Policy decision

Deposit facility rate: 2.00%

Decision type: HOLD

Decision rationale (reaction-function read)

Inflation expected to stabilise at target in the medium term; policy remains sufficiently restrictive; emphasis on underlying inflation and persistence.

Projections framework (published)

Headline HICP averages: 2025 2.1; 2026 1.9; 2027 1.8; 2028 2.0

Core (ex energy & food) averages: 2025 2.4; 2026 2.2; 2027 1.9; 2028 2.0

Key change: 2026 inflation revised up mainly due to slower services disinflation; growth revised stronger than Sep, driven by domestic demand.
Implied trajectory:

Base case is restrictive plateau; easing optionality is conditional on services/wages confirmation (not on one weak manufacturing print).

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)
Rehn (GC member) – 19 Dec 2025

Core message: outlook highly uncertain due to trade/geopolitics; risks remain meaningful despite some positive developments.

Bias: neutral (risk-management framing)

Adds/changes: reinforces that external uncertainty is a live tail, keeping optionality high.

Lagarde (President) – 18 Dec 2025 (press conference)

Core message: hold; confidence improving but persistence risks remain; full data-dependence.

Bias: neutral-to-hawkish (plateau defended)

Adds/changes: aligns messaging with projection change — underlying/services persistence matters more than headline comfort.

Mandatory HF synthesis (reaction-function snapshot)

Reaction function: “Hold on a restrictive plateau until services/underlying inflation convincingly slows; treat manufacturing weakness as a tail unless labour/services spillover emerges.”

What changed in the last month: stronger institutional comfort with plateau persistence, driven by services inflation dynamics and projection revisions.

====================================================
5) Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Political guideline applied (macro transmission only; short-horizon + rolling assessment).

In-window (19 Dec – 2 Jan): key political/fiscal channel is France fiscal uncertainty / budget politics and its second-order impact on confidence and risk premium, rather than an immediate mechanical hit to macro prints.

Transmission: policy uncertainty → business confidence / capex caution → services hiring at the margin; also sovereign-spread risk premium channel (financial conditions).

Rolling (past ~1 month): trade-policy uncertainty remains a structural tail for the euro area via the export/manufacturing channel, particularly Germany’s export complex; this matters because the current regime’s fragility is concentrated in manufacturing orders (consistent with the PMI deterioration).

Bottom line: politics is not the base-case growth driver in this window, but it fattens tails (confidence + risk premium) exactly where the regime is weakest (manufacturing + spillover risk).

====================================================
6) Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (macro-driven)

Front-end: anchored by ECB plateau; sensitivity highest to services inflation / wage confirmation and to communication validating/invalidating “hold for longer”.

Curve/term premium: capped by low-trend growth; steepening risk is primarily “services persistence” rather than “growth acceleration”.

EUR (relative by construction)

Support: credible inflation convergence + ECB plateau vs peers with more easing bias; stabilising hard data anchors the “no recession” floor.

Drag: renewed manufacturing contraction and weakening orders; political risk premium tail (France) can intermittently weigh via spreads.

EUR trigger map:
• EUR-positive: services persistence + ECB plateau longer without growth accident.
• EUR-negative: services/labour rollover + earlier easing optionality.

Consensus lens (professional narrative consistency check)

Macro consensus: stabilisation, not rebound; manufacturing weak; services resilient.

ECB path consensus: hold near-term; next move timing uncertain; tails include “next move hike” conditional on services persistence.

FX consensus: range-bound; driven by relative rates and risk premium.

🇪🇺 EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 9 Dec 2025 (Paris)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

The euro area remains in a soft-landing / low-trend expansion:

Activity: Composite PMI 52.8 in Nov, 6th month >50; services strong, manufacturing still a drag.

Demand: Retail volumes flat m/m in Oct, +1.5% y/y → steady but uninspiring consumption.

Prices: PPI around +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y in Oct, and HICP flash 2.2% in Nov (2.1% Oct) → goods disinflation intact, headline essentially at target.

Germany printed strong-looking October IP +1.8% m/m and orders +1.5% m/m, but both are skewed by a huge transport/defence order; underlying momentum is still weak.

France: Banque de France nowcasts Q4 GDP +0.2% q/q after +0.5% in Q3 – industrial sector above its long-run average for a 6th month; services/construction broadly flat.

Italy and Spain remain the growth stabilisers: Italy’s composite PMI at 53.8 (best in 2½ years), Spain’s at 55.1, with Spain’s IP and retail clearly positive y/y.

New structural shift: Schnabel (ECB) told Bloomberg “the next move may be a hike, not a cut”, even if “not anytime soon” → markets now price two-sided ECB risk and a small 2026 hike probability.

HF lens:
EA macro is boringly stable, but the policy narrative is no longer one-way to cuts. Growth is mediocre, inflation near 2%, but Schnabel has re-opened the hike option if r* proves higher and services/wages stop disinflating.

Euro Area – Top-Down: Activity, Demand, Prices, Credit

1.1 Activity & Demand

GDP Q3: +0.2% q/q, +1.4% y/y – soft-landing mix (Spain/France strong, Germany flat, Italy stagnant).

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.8 vs 52.5 Oct; flash 52.4. Strongest in ~30 months.
– Services PMI comfortably in expansion
– Manufacturing still flirting with contraction and weak new orders

Industrial Production (Sep): +0.2% m/m, +1.2% y/y after −1.1% in Aug → “stabilisation”, not a new industrial upswing.

Retail Trade (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +1.5% y/y; food volumes +0.3% m/m, non-food −0.2% m/m.

Signal:
EA demand is chugging, not surging. Services keep top-line growth positive; goods and retail are adequate but not strong enough to generate an output gap shock.

1.2 Prices & Pipeline

HICP Oct: 2.1% y/y (down from 2.2% in Sep).
HICP flash Nov: 2.2% y/y – a 0.1pp uptick, still essentially at target.
Industrial PPI (Oct): +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y (after −0.1% m/m in Sep). Goods-price pipeline clearly disinflationary.

Signal:
Inflation is “done” in goods, but services + wages are still above 2%-consistent levels – exactly the mix that justifies a long plateau or, in Schnabel’s framing, potential re-tightening if r* is higher.

1.3 Credit & Money

Bank lending (Oct):
– Loans to firms +2.9% y/y, unchanged vs Sep
– Loans to households +2.8% y/y, highest in ~2½ years

M3 money supply (Oct): +2.8% y/y, stable.

Signal:
Credit conditions are restrictive but not choking: lending volumes are grinding higher, especially to households, consistent with modest, not booming, growth.

Germany – Weak Core, No True Turn Yet

2.1 Hard Data – “Good Headlines, Bad Internals”

Industrial Production (Oct): +1.8% m/m; truck toll mileage index +0.3% m/m. IP is still significantly below Feb-23 levels.

Factory Orders (Oct): +1.5% m/m – sounds strong, but:
– Driven by an ~87% jump in “other transport equipment” (aircraft/ships/trains/defence)
– Core orders ex-big transport are only mildly positive

Stock of orders (Sep): +0.6% m/m, implying the backlog is stabilising, not being rapidly run down.

Read:
October looks like a one-off big-ticket rescue, not a broad-based industrial turn.

2.2 Surveys & Sentiment

HCOB Germany Services PMI (Nov): 53.1 vs 54.6 Oct – services still expanding but momentum cooling.

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.4 vs 53.9 Oct – 6th month >50, but clear deceleration.

Commentary: Services are keeping overall GDP slightly positive in Q4 despite a deepening manufacturing recession.

Read:
Germany’s growth is services-propped, manufacturing-dragged. PMI levels say Q4 is positive, but momentum is fading, and sentiment is cautious.

2.3 Prices

CPI (Oct): 2.3% y/y.
PPI: around −1.8% y/y, confirming Germany as a goods-price disinflation anchor.

HF takeaway (DE):
Behind the upbeat “IP + orders beat” headlines, Germany remains a low-growth, low-inflation core.
Industrial demand is still soft once you strip out defence/transport.
Services keep GDP positive but are not strong enough to power EA.
From an ECB perspective, Germany is dovish, not hawkish.

France – Industrial Resilience, Slower Q4

3.1 Activity & Nowcast

GDP Q3: +0.5% q/q, the best in the big-4; driven by exports (aerospace) and corporate capex.

Banque de France survey (Dec 9):
– Q4 GDP nowcast +0.2% q/q, enough to hit ≥0.8% growth for 2025
– Industry above long-run average for the 6th month in a row, led by computer/electronic/optical products, agro-food and autos
– Services & construction broadly flat in Nov and expected to stay flat in Dec

3.2 Surveys

HCOB France Composite PMI (Nov final): 50.4 vs 47.7 Oct, back above 50, driven by a rebound in services.

3.3 Prices

Inflation (Oct):
– CPI: +0.9% y/y
– HICP: +0.8% y/y → lowest among big-4

HF takeaway (FR):
France is no longer the spectacular outlier, but it remains the macro stabiliser.
Industry robust relative to peers.
Q4 slowdown, but still positive.
Very low inflation gives the ECB no reason to fear France.

Italy – Services-Led Grind Higher

4.1 Surveys

HCOB Italy Composite PMI (Nov): 53.8 vs 53.1 Oct – highest in ~2½ years.
Services lead growth; manufacturing back in mild expansion.

4.2 Hard Data

Retail Sales (Oct):
– +0.5% m/m value, +0.4% m/m volume
– ~+1.3% y/y in value, roughly flat in volume
First positive print in 3 months.

PPI (Oct): industrial producer prices around flat y/y, −0.2% m/m, with construction PPI modestly positive.

4.3 Outlook

Istat Outlook: real GDP +0.5% in 2025, +0.8% in 2026 after +0.7% in 2024 – trend growth low but positive.

HF takeaway (IT):
Italy is running a services-led, low-beta expansion.
Retail finally turning.
Inflation benign.
Business surveys firm.
It quietly supports EA growth without creating inflation or credit risk.

Spain – EA’s Cleanest Cyclical Long

5.1 Surveys

HCOB Spain Services PMI (Nov): 55.6 vs 56.6 Oct, still very strong.
HCOB Spain Composite PMI (Nov): 55.1 vs 56.0 Oct – robust job creation continues.

5.2 Hard Data

Industrial Production (Oct): +0.7% m/m, +1.2% y/y.
Retail Sales (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +3.8% y/y in real terms.

5.3 Policy backdrop

Government raised its 2025 growth forecast to 2.9%, citing strong tourism, immigration-driven labour supply and resilient domestic demand.

HF takeaway (ES):
Spain remains the main reason the EA composite PMI looks good.
Real activity is clearly expanding.
Inflation is near target.
Spain is the clean cyclical long within EA.

ECB Speaker Tape – Last 5–7 Days and Reaction Function

6.1 Schnabel – “Next Move May Be a Hike”

Key lines from the last days:
– Stated that “the next move may be a hike, not a cut”, though “not anytime soon”.
– Explicitly said she is comfortable with markets pricing a small hike.
– Argued that disinflation in services and wages has stalled, fiscal policy remains expansionary in several countries, and the neutral rate r* may be higher than previously assumed.
– Warned that leaving policy at 2 percent could become passively too accommodative if r* has indeed shifted up.

Impact on reaction function:
– Converts ECB from “eventual cuts” bias to a genuinely two-sided stance.
– Reintroduces upside policy risk (re-tightening) if incoming data confirm sticky services/wage inflation and a higher r*.
– Raises the bar for cuts: they now require a clear, repeated downshift in wage growth and services inflation and/or a hard deterioration in activity/credit.

6.2 Nagel – Hawkish Ceiling

Recent messages:
– Emphasises that inflation risks have not disappeared and warns against “declaring victory too early”.
– Pushes back against any rapid easing narrative, stressing the need to see core inflation and wages firmly back at target-consistent levels.

Impact:
– Sets the hawkish ceiling inside the Governing Council: he will resist cuts while inflation risks are perceived as balanced-to-upside.
– Reinforces the idea that German weakness alone is not sufficient to trigger easing.

6.3 Lane – Data Sequencer and Gatekeeper

Recent messages:
– Stresses sequencing: ECB must observe several quarters of cooling wages and services prices.
– Frames cuts as conditional on a broad-based confirmation from wage trackers, labour costs, and underlying inflation indicators.

Impact:
– Lane effectively acts as the “gatekeeper” for cuts: his framework means the ECB will wait for a series of confirming data points, not a single print.
– This delays the timing of the first cut even in benign scenarios.

6.4 Villeroy and De Guindos – Eventual Cuts, No Rush

Recent messages:
– Reiterate that policy has peaked (“we are at the terminal rate”), but insist there is “no urgency” to cut.
– Present eventual easing as “normalisation”, not as cyclical support.

Impact:
– Anchor market expectations around cuts “sometime in 2026” rather than 2025.
– Provide a dovish floor but fully consistent with Schnabel’s two-sided narrative.

6.5 Kazimir and Others – Vigilance on Upside Risks

Recent messages:
– Stress that inflation can still surprise to the upside, given geopolitical and fiscal risks.
– Argue that the ECB should avoid pre-committing to cuts.

Impact:
– Strengthens the idea that the reaction function is symmetric or even slightly skewed toward staying tight.
– Supports higher-for-longer pricing at the front end.

Speaker Tape HF Synthesis:
– Schnabel’s pivot is the signal: the next move “may be a hike”, not a cut.
– Nagel provides the hawkish ceiling; Lane enforces the data-dependent delay; Villeroy/De Guindos shift cuts into a distant, normalisation framing.
– Net: the ECB reaction function is now clearly two-sided, with a meaningful probability of “no cuts for a long time” and a non-zero probability of re-tightening if services/wage disinflation stalls.

FX & Rates – Macro Attribution (No Flow Stories)

7.1 EURUSD

EURUSD has traded roughly in a 1.160–1.168 range over the last week, with very low realised volatility.

Macro interpretation:
– Before Schnabel: EUR was mainly a USD-beta trade; EA macro was too dull to matter.
– After Schnabel: ECB is marginally more hawkish than the Fed at the margin, as the Fed is moving deeper into an easing cycle.

Implications:
– Raises the EUR policy-rate floor for 2026.
– Provides mild structural support for EUR vs USD, even if growth is mediocre.

7.2 EUR Rates / Bunds

– Schnabel’s pivot pushes front-end EUR rates higher; fewer cuts priced, some hike probability added.
– The curve flattens: short-end reprices hawkish risk; long-end remains tied to global duration but with less embedded easing premium.
– Bunds behave more like pure global-duration assets, but with increased sensitivity to EA inflation surprises.

HF takeaway (markets):
– EUR supported on dips due to policy divergence.
– EUR duration less attractive; owning a lot of long-end EUR rates is more a bet on global growth/Fed than on ECB easing.
– Front-end shorts (or at least avoiding long front-end duration) are better aligned with the revealed ECB reaction function.

Cross-Market Macro Summary (for positioning)

Macro regime: EA in a steady soft landing; Spain and Italy offset Germany’s weakness.
Inflation: near target; goods disinflation vs sticky services/wages keeps the ECB cautious.
ECB: Schnabel’s remarks re-introduce hike optionality; reaction function is no longer biased toward cuts.
EUR: mild structural tailwind vs USD from policy divergence.
Rates: upside risk to yields at the front end; long-end still trades global-beta.

From a hedge-fund macro perspective, EA data no longer justify a pure “dovish ECB / long duration” theme. The more interesting angle is relative policy divergence (ECB vs Fed/BoE) and intra-EA growth dispersion (Spain/Italy vs Germany) rather than outright EA collapse or reflation.
