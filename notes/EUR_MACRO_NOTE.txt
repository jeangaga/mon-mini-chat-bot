🇪🇺 EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run

Date: 9 Dec 2025 (Paris)

0) Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

The euro area remains in a soft-landing / low-trend expansion:

Activity: Composite PMI 52.8 in Nov, 6th month >50; services strong, manufacturing still a drag. 
Trading Economics
+1

Demand: Retail volumes flat m/m in Oct, +1.5% y/y → steady but uninspiring consumption. 
European Commission
+1

Prices: PPI +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y in Oct, and HICP flash 2.2% in Nov (2.1% Oct) → goods disinflation intact, headline essentially at target. 
European Commission

Germany printed strong-looking October IP +1.8% m/m and orders +1.5% m/m, but both are skewed by a huge transport order; underlying momentum is still weak. 
Destatis

France: Banque de France nowcasts Q4 GDP +0.2% q/q after +0.5% in Q3 – industrial sector above its long-run average for a 6th month; services/construction broadly flat. 
Reuters

Italy and Spain remain the growth stabilisers: Italy’s composite PMI at 53.8 (best in 2½ years), Spain’s at 55.1, with Spain’s IP and retail clearly positive y/y.

New structural shift: Schnabel (ECB) told Bloomberg “the next move may be a hike, not a cut”, even if “not anytime soon” → markets now price two-sided ECB risk and a small 2026 hike probability.

Reuters

HF lens:
EA macro is boringly stable, but the policy narrative is no longer one-way to cuts. Growth is mediocre, inflation near 2%, but Schnabel has re-opened the hike option if r* proves higher and services/wages stop disinflating.

1) Euro Area – Top-Down: Activity, Demand, Prices, Credit
1.1 Activity & Demand

GDP Q3: +0.2% q/q, +1.4% y/y – soft-landing mix (Spain/France strong, Germany flat, Italy stagnant). 
European Commission
+1

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.8 vs 52.5 Oct; flash 52.4. Strongest in ~30 months:

Services PMI comfortably in expansion;

Manufacturing still flirting with contraction and weak new orders. 
Trading Economics
+1

Industrial Production (Sep): +0.2% m/m, +1.2% y/y after −1.1% in Aug → “stabilisation”, not a new industrial upswing. 
European Commission
+1

Retail Trade (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +1.5% y/y; food volumes +0.3% m/m, non-food −0.2% m/m. 
European Commission
+1

Signal:
EA demand is chugging, not surging. Services keep top-line growth positive; goods and retail are adequate but not strong enough to generate an output gap shock.

1.2 Prices & Pipeline

HICP Oct: 2.1% y/y (down from 2.2% in Sep). 
European Commission

HICP flash Nov: 2.2% y/y – a 0.1pp uptick, still essentially at target. 
European Commission

Industrial PPI (Oct): +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y (after −0.1% m/m in Sep). Goods price pipeline clearly disinflationary. 
European Commission

Signal:
Inflation is “done” in goods, but services + wages are still above 2%-consistent levels – exactly the mix that justifies a long plateau or, in Schnabel’s framing, potential re-tightening if r* is higher.

1.3 Credit & Money

Bank lending (Oct):

Loans to firms +2.9% y/y, unchanged vs Sep.

Loans to households +2.8% y/y, highest in ~2½ years.

M3 money supply (Oct): +2.8% y/y, stable. 
tradingview.com
+1

Signal:
Credit conditions are restrictive but not choking: lending volumes are grinding higher, especially to households, consistent with modest, not booming, growth.

2) Germany – Weak Core, No True Turn Yet
2.1 Hard Data – “Good Headlines, Bad Internals”

Industrial Production (Oct): +1.8% m/m, per Destatis; truck toll mileage index +0.3% m/m. IP is still significantly below Feb-23 levels. 
Destatis

Factory Orders (Oct): +1.5% m/m – sounds strong, but:

Driven by an ~87% jump in “other transport equipment” (aircraft/ships/trains/defence). 
Destatis
+2
Anadolu Ajansı
+2

Core orders ex-big transport are only mildly positive.

Stock of orders (Sep): +0.6% m/m, implying the backlog is stabilising, not being rapidly run down. 
Destatis

Read:
October looks like a one-off big-ticket rescue, not a broad-based industrial turn.

2.2 Surveys & Sentiment

HCOB Germany Services PMI (Nov): 53.1 vs 54.6 Oct – services still expanding but momentum cooling. 
Reuters
+1

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.4 vs 53.9 Oct – 6th month >50, but clear deceleration. 
PMI
+2
Trading Economics

Reuters commentary: services are keeping overall GDP slightly positive in Q4 despite a “deepening manufacturing recession”. 
Reuters

Read:
Germany’s growth is services-propped, manufacturing-dragged. PMI levels say Q4 is positive, but momentum is fading, and sentiment is cautious.

2.3 Prices

CPI (Oct): 2.3% y/y (weaker than EA average). 
tradingview.com

PPI: around −1.8% y/y, confirming Germany as a goods-price disinflation anchor. 
Hürriyet Daily News

HF takeaway (DE):
Behind the upbeat “IP + orders beat” headlines, Germany remains a low-growth, low-inflation core:

Industrial demand is still soft once you strip out defence/transport.

Services keep GDP positive but are not strong enough to power EA.

From an ECB perspective, Germany is dovish, not hawkish.

3) France – Industrial Resilience, Slower Q4
3.1 Activity & Nowcast

GDP Q3: +0.5% q/q, the best in the big-4; driven by exports (aerospace) and corporate capex. 
PMI

European Commission
+2

Banque de France survey (Dec 9):

Q4 GDP nowcast +0.2% q/q, enough to hit ≥0.8% growth for 2025.

Industry above long-run average for the 6th month in a row, led by computer/electronic/optical products, agro-food and autos.

Services & construction broadly flat in Nov and expected to stay flat in Dec. 
Reuters

3.2 Surveys

HCOB France Composite PMI (Nov final): 50.4 vs 47.7 Oct, back above 50, driven by a rebound in services. 
Trading Economics
+1

3.3 Prices

Inflation (Oct):

CPI: +0.9% y/y;

HICP: +0.8% y/y → lowest among big-4. 
European Commission
+2
Reuters
+2

HF takeaway (FR):
France is no longer the spectacular outlier, but it remains the macro stabiliser:

Industry robust relative to peers;

Q4 slowdown, but still positive;

Very low inflation gives the ECB no reason to fear France.

4) Italy – Services-Led Grind Higher
4.1 Surveys

HCOB Italy Composite PMI (Nov): 53.8 vs 53.1 Oct – highest in ~2½ years;

Services lead growth;

Manufacturing back in mild expansion. 
Trading Economics

4.2 Hard Data

Retail Sales (Oct):

+0.5% m/m value, +0.4% m/m volume;

~+1.3% y/y in value, roughly flat in volume. First positive print in 3 months.

PPI (Oct): industrial producer prices around flat y/y, −0.2% m/m, with construction PPI modestly positive.

4.3 Outlook

Istat Outlook: projects real GDP +0.5% in 2025, +0.8% in 2026 after +0.7% in 2024 – trend growth is low but positive.

HF takeaway (IT):
Italy is running a services-led, low-beta expansion:

Retail finally turning,

Inflation benign,

Business surveys firm.
It quietly supports EA growth without creating inflation or credit risk.

5) Spain – EA’s Cleanest Cyclical Long
5.1 Surveys

HCOB Spain Services PMI (Nov): 55.6 vs 56.6 Oct, still very strong. 
Trading Economics

HCOB Spain Composite PMI (Nov): 55.1 vs 56.0 Oct, meaningfully above 50; robust job creation continues.

5.2 Hard Data

Industrial Production (Oct): +0.7% m/m, +1.2% y/y (sa & cal-adj).

Retail Sales (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +3.8% y/y in real terms.

5.3 Policy backdrop

Government has raised its 2025 growth forecast to 2.9%, citing strong tourism, immigration-driven labour supply and resilient domestic demand.

HF takeaway (ES):
Spain remains the main reason the EA composite PMI looks good:

Real activity is clearly expanding;

Inflation is near target;

From a portfolio perspective, Spain is the clean cyclical long within EA, given both macro and policy.

6) ECB Reaction Function – Speaker Tape After Schnabel Pivot
6.1 Schnabel – “Next Move May Be a Hike”

In a Bloomberg interview (8 Dec), Schnabel stated:

“The next move may be a hike, not a cut”, albeit “not anytime soon”. 
Reuters

She is “comfortable” with markets pricing a small hike. 
Financial Times

Argument:

Underlying disinflation has stalled;

Fiscal expansion, AI/productivity and trade shifts may have raised r*;

Keeping rates at 2% could become passively too easy if r* is indeed higher. 
Reuters
+1

Implication:
Schnabel converts the ECB from a one-way “cuts eventually” story to a two-sided regime: if r* is higher and inflation proves sticky, re-tightening is back on the table.

6.2 Other Governing Council Signals (latest)

Core line from previous days (Nagel, Lane, Villeroy, Kazimir):

Inflation risks are no longer one-sided downward;

Wage & services inflation must print several more moderating rounds before any easing;

Current policy is in a “good place” – i.e., restrictive but not painfully so. 
Reuters
+2
tradingview.com

6.3 HF Synthesis of ECB Reaction Function

Inflation near target, but services/wages not yet settled → no cuts on the horizon.

With Schnabel explicitly opening the door to future hikes, markets must respect upside policy risk (even if low-probability near term).

The bar for easing is higher: it now requires either

Clear downside surprises in services/wage inflation, or

A hard deterioration in real activity/credit – neither is present yet.

Net:
ECB is now asymmetric toward staying tight or tightening again, not toward early easing.

7) FX & Rates – Macro Attribution (No Flow Stories)
7.1 EURUSD

ECB reference rate today: 1 EUR ≈ 1.1637 USD; spot around 1.163–1.164. 
European Central Bank
+2
Trading Economics
+2

Over the past week, EUR has traded in a 1.160–1.168 range, very low realised vol. 
Wise

Macro interpretation:

Before Schnabel: EUR was mainly a USD-beta trade, with EA macro too dull to matter.

After Schnabel: the ECB is more hawkish at the margin than the Fed (which is moving deeper into an easing cycle). That:

Raises the EUR policy-rate floor for 2026;

Gives EUR mild policy support vs USD, even if the growth story is not exciting.

7.2 EUR Rates / Bunds

The Schnabel pivot pushes front-end EUR rates higher and flattens the curve:

Less cuts priced, some hike probability added for 2026. 
Financial Times
+1

10Y Bunds still trade heavily as global duration, but with:

Less embedded easing premium,

More sensitivity to EA inflation surprises than six months ago.

HF takeaway (markets):

EURFX:

No “macro boom” to drive a powerful rally,

But ECB’s two-sided stance + Fed easing bias give EUR support on dips.

Rates:

Owning a lot of EUR duration is now more a bet on global growth/Fed than on ECB cuts.

Front-end shorts (or at least not being long) are now better aligned with the central bank’s revealed preference.

8) Cross-Market Macro Summary (for positioning)

Macro regime: EA in steady soft landing; no recession data, no boom; Spain and Italy offset Germany.

Inflation: near target, but goods disinflation vs sticky services/wages keeps ECB cautious.

ECB: Schnabel’s remarks re-introduce hike optionality; reaction function is no longer biased toward cuts.

EURFX: mild structural tailwind vs USD from policy divergence.

Rates:

Front-end: upside risk to yields (less cuts, potential future hike).

Long-end: global-beta trade, still supported by Fed trajectory and global duration demand.

From a hedge-fund macro perspective, EA data no longer justify a pure “dovish ECB / long duration” theme. The more interesting angle is relative policy divergence (ECB vs Fed/BoE) and intra-EA growth dispersion (Spain/Italy vs Germany) rather than outright EA collapse or reflation.
