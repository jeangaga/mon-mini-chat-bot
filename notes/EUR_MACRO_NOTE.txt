🇪🇺 EUR Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 9 Dec 2025 (Paris)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

The euro area remains in a soft-landing / low-trend expansion:

Activity: Composite PMI 52.8 in Nov, 6th month >50; services strong, manufacturing still a drag.

Demand: Retail volumes flat m/m in Oct, +1.5% y/y → steady but uninspiring consumption.

Prices: PPI around +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y in Oct, and HICP flash 2.2% in Nov (2.1% Oct) → goods disinflation intact, headline essentially at target.

Germany printed strong-looking October IP +1.8% m/m and orders +1.5% m/m, but both are skewed by a huge transport/defence order; underlying momentum is still weak.

France: Banque de France nowcasts Q4 GDP +0.2% q/q after +0.5% in Q3 – industrial sector above its long-run average for a 6th month; services/construction broadly flat.

Italy and Spain remain the growth stabilisers: Italy’s composite PMI at 53.8 (best in 2½ years), Spain’s at 55.1, with Spain’s IP and retail clearly positive y/y.

New structural shift: Schnabel (ECB) told Bloomberg “the next move may be a hike, not a cut”, even if “not anytime soon” → markets now price two-sided ECB risk and a small 2026 hike probability.

HF lens:
EA macro is boringly stable, but the policy narrative is no longer one-way to cuts. Growth is mediocre, inflation near 2%, but Schnabel has re-opened the hike option if r* proves higher and services/wages stop disinflating.

Euro Area – Top-Down: Activity, Demand, Prices, Credit

1.1 Activity & Demand

GDP Q3: +0.2% q/q, +1.4% y/y – soft-landing mix (Spain/France strong, Germany flat, Italy stagnant).

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.8 vs 52.5 Oct; flash 52.4. Strongest in ~30 months.
– Services PMI comfortably in expansion
– Manufacturing still flirting with contraction and weak new orders

Industrial Production (Sep): +0.2% m/m, +1.2% y/y after −1.1% in Aug → “stabilisation”, not a new industrial upswing.

Retail Trade (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +1.5% y/y; food volumes +0.3% m/m, non-food −0.2% m/m.

Signal:
EA demand is chugging, not surging. Services keep top-line growth positive; goods and retail are adequate but not strong enough to generate an output gap shock.

1.2 Prices & Pipeline

HICP Oct: 2.1% y/y (down from 2.2% in Sep).
HICP flash Nov: 2.2% y/y – a 0.1pp uptick, still essentially at target.
Industrial PPI (Oct): +0.1% m/m, −0.5% y/y (after −0.1% m/m in Sep). Goods-price pipeline clearly disinflationary.

Signal:
Inflation is “done” in goods, but services + wages are still above 2%-consistent levels – exactly the mix that justifies a long plateau or, in Schnabel’s framing, potential re-tightening if r* is higher.

1.3 Credit & Money

Bank lending (Oct):
– Loans to firms +2.9% y/y, unchanged vs Sep
– Loans to households +2.8% y/y, highest in ~2½ years

M3 money supply (Oct): +2.8% y/y, stable.

Signal:
Credit conditions are restrictive but not choking: lending volumes are grinding higher, especially to households, consistent with modest, not booming, growth.

Germany – Weak Core, No True Turn Yet

2.1 Hard Data – “Good Headlines, Bad Internals”

Industrial Production (Oct): +1.8% m/m; truck toll mileage index +0.3% m/m. IP is still significantly below Feb-23 levels.

Factory Orders (Oct): +1.5% m/m – sounds strong, but:
– Driven by an ~87% jump in “other transport equipment” (aircraft/ships/trains/defence)
– Core orders ex-big transport are only mildly positive

Stock of orders (Sep): +0.6% m/m, implying the backlog is stabilising, not being rapidly run down.

Read:
October looks like a one-off big-ticket rescue, not a broad-based industrial turn.

2.2 Surveys & Sentiment

HCOB Germany Services PMI (Nov): 53.1 vs 54.6 Oct – services still expanding but momentum cooling.

Composite PMI (Nov final): 52.4 vs 53.9 Oct – 6th month >50, but clear deceleration.

Commentary: Services are keeping overall GDP slightly positive in Q4 despite a deepening manufacturing recession.

Read:
Germany’s growth is services-propped, manufacturing-dragged. PMI levels say Q4 is positive, but momentum is fading, and sentiment is cautious.

2.3 Prices

CPI (Oct): 2.3% y/y.
PPI: around −1.8% y/y, confirming Germany as a goods-price disinflation anchor.

HF takeaway (DE):
Behind the upbeat “IP + orders beat” headlines, Germany remains a low-growth, low-inflation core.
Industrial demand is still soft once you strip out defence/transport.
Services keep GDP positive but are not strong enough to power EA.
From an ECB perspective, Germany is dovish, not hawkish.

France – Industrial Resilience, Slower Q4

3.1 Activity & Nowcast

GDP Q3: +0.5% q/q, the best in the big-4; driven by exports (aerospace) and corporate capex.

Banque de France survey (Dec 9):
– Q4 GDP nowcast +0.2% q/q, enough to hit ≥0.8% growth for 2025
– Industry above long-run average for the 6th month in a row, led by computer/electronic/optical products, agro-food and autos
– Services & construction broadly flat in Nov and expected to stay flat in Dec

3.2 Surveys

HCOB France Composite PMI (Nov final): 50.4 vs 47.7 Oct, back above 50, driven by a rebound in services.

3.3 Prices

Inflation (Oct):
– CPI: +0.9% y/y
– HICP: +0.8% y/y → lowest among big-4

HF takeaway (FR):
France is no longer the spectacular outlier, but it remains the macro stabiliser.
Industry robust relative to peers.
Q4 slowdown, but still positive.
Very low inflation gives the ECB no reason to fear France.

Italy – Services-Led Grind Higher

4.1 Surveys

HCOB Italy Composite PMI (Nov): 53.8 vs 53.1 Oct – highest in ~2½ years.
Services lead growth; manufacturing back in mild expansion.

4.2 Hard Data

Retail Sales (Oct):
– +0.5% m/m value, +0.4% m/m volume
– ~+1.3% y/y in value, roughly flat in volume
First positive print in 3 months.

PPI (Oct): industrial producer prices around flat y/y, −0.2% m/m, with construction PPI modestly positive.

4.3 Outlook

Istat Outlook: real GDP +0.5% in 2025, +0.8% in 2026 after +0.7% in 2024 – trend growth low but positive.

HF takeaway (IT):
Italy is running a services-led, low-beta expansion.
Retail finally turning.
Inflation benign.
Business surveys firm.
It quietly supports EA growth without creating inflation or credit risk.

Spain – EA’s Cleanest Cyclical Long

5.1 Surveys

HCOB Spain Services PMI (Nov): 55.6 vs 56.6 Oct, still very strong.
HCOB Spain Composite PMI (Nov): 55.1 vs 56.0 Oct – robust job creation continues.

5.2 Hard Data

Industrial Production (Oct): +0.7% m/m, +1.2% y/y.
Retail Sales (Oct): 0.0% m/m, +3.8% y/y in real terms.

5.3 Policy backdrop

Government raised its 2025 growth forecast to 2.9%, citing strong tourism, immigration-driven labour supply and resilient domestic demand.

HF takeaway (ES):
Spain remains the main reason the EA composite PMI looks good.
Real activity is clearly expanding.
Inflation is near target.
Spain is the clean cyclical long within EA.

ECB Speaker Tape – Last 5–7 Days and Reaction Function

6.1 Schnabel – “Next Move May Be a Hike”

Key lines from the last days:
– Stated that “the next move may be a hike, not a cut”, though “not anytime soon”.
– Explicitly said she is comfortable with markets pricing a small hike.
– Argued that disinflation in services and wages has stalled, fiscal policy remains expansionary in several countries, and the neutral rate r* may be higher than previously assumed.
– Warned that leaving policy at 2 percent could become passively too accommodative if r* has indeed shifted up.

Impact on reaction function:
– Converts ECB from “eventual cuts” bias to a genuinely two-sided stance.
– Reintroduces upside policy risk (re-tightening) if incoming data confirm sticky services/wage inflation and a higher r*.
– Raises the bar for cuts: they now require a clear, repeated downshift in wage growth and services inflation and/or a hard deterioration in activity/credit.

6.2 Nagel – Hawkish Ceiling

Recent messages:
– Emphasises that inflation risks have not disappeared and warns against “declaring victory too early”.
– Pushes back against any rapid easing narrative, stressing the need to see core inflation and wages firmly back at target-consistent levels.

Impact:
– Sets the hawkish ceiling inside the Governing Council: he will resist cuts while inflation risks are perceived as balanced-to-upside.
– Reinforces the idea that German weakness alone is not sufficient to trigger easing.

6.3 Lane – Data Sequencer and Gatekeeper

Recent messages:
– Stresses sequencing: ECB must observe several quarters of cooling wages and services prices.
– Frames cuts as conditional on a broad-based confirmation from wage trackers, labour costs, and underlying inflation indicators.

Impact:
– Lane effectively acts as the “gatekeeper” for cuts: his framework means the ECB will wait for a series of confirming data points, not a single print.
– This delays the timing of the first cut even in benign scenarios.

6.4 Villeroy and De Guindos – Eventual Cuts, No Rush

Recent messages:
– Reiterate that policy has peaked (“we are at the terminal rate”), but insist there is “no urgency” to cut.
– Present eventual easing as “normalisation”, not as cyclical support.

Impact:
– Anchor market expectations around cuts “sometime in 2026” rather than 2025.
– Provide a dovish floor but fully consistent with Schnabel’s two-sided narrative.

6.5 Kazimir and Others – Vigilance on Upside Risks

Recent messages:
– Stress that inflation can still surprise to the upside, given geopolitical and fiscal risks.
– Argue that the ECB should avoid pre-committing to cuts.

Impact:
– Strengthens the idea that the reaction function is symmetric or even slightly skewed toward staying tight.
– Supports higher-for-longer pricing at the front end.

Speaker Tape HF Synthesis:
– Schnabel’s pivot is the signal: the next move “may be a hike”, not a cut.
– Nagel provides the hawkish ceiling; Lane enforces the data-dependent delay; Villeroy/De Guindos shift cuts into a distant, normalisation framing.
– Net: the ECB reaction function is now clearly two-sided, with a meaningful probability of “no cuts for a long time” and a non-zero probability of re-tightening if services/wage disinflation stalls.

FX & Rates – Macro Attribution (No Flow Stories)

7.1 EURUSD

EURUSD has traded roughly in a 1.160–1.168 range over the last week, with very low realised volatility.

Macro interpretation:
– Before Schnabel: EUR was mainly a USD-beta trade; EA macro was too dull to matter.
– After Schnabel: ECB is marginally more hawkish than the Fed at the margin, as the Fed is moving deeper into an easing cycle.

Implications:
– Raises the EUR policy-rate floor for 2026.
– Provides mild structural support for EUR vs USD, even if growth is mediocre.

7.2 EUR Rates / Bunds

– Schnabel’s pivot pushes front-end EUR rates higher; fewer cuts priced, some hike probability added.
– The curve flattens: short-end reprices hawkish risk; long-end remains tied to global duration but with less embedded easing premium.
– Bunds behave more like pure global-duration assets, but with increased sensitivity to EA inflation surprises.

HF takeaway (markets):
– EUR supported on dips due to policy divergence.
– EUR duration less attractive; owning a lot of long-end EUR rates is more a bet on global growth/Fed than on ECB easing.
– Front-end shorts (or at least avoiding long front-end duration) are better aligned with the revealed ECB reaction function.

Cross-Market Macro Summary (for positioning)

Macro regime: EA in a steady soft landing; Spain and Italy offset Germany’s weakness.
Inflation: near target; goods disinflation vs sticky services/wages keeps the ECB cautious.
ECB: Schnabel’s remarks re-introduce hike optionality; reaction function is no longer biased toward cuts.
EUR: mild structural tailwind vs USD from policy divergence.
Rates: upside risk to yields at the front end; long-end still trades global-beta.

From a hedge-fund macro perspective, EA data no longer justify a pure “dovish ECB / long duration” theme. The more interesting angle is relative policy divergence (ECB vs Fed/BoE) and intra-EA growth dispersion (Spain/Italy vs Germany) rather than outright EA collapse or reflation.
