MXN Macro Note — FOUNDATION (Mexico)
Date: 19 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Scope: Foundational regime anchor + reaction-function map
Primary window (last ~2 weeks of realised macro tape): early–mid Jan 2026 (no major high-frequency surprises overriding the structural frame)
Rolling perspective (anchors & structural constraints): past ~3–12 months

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

FOUNDATION REGIME (define the state of the world):
Mexico is in a “trade–policy–inflation tension” regime where weak growth, sticky core/services inflation, and a tight Mexico–US rate differential constrain monetary easing, while USMCA uncertainty and domestic institutional policy choices dominate medium-term risk premia. Fiscal consolidation is proceeding, but only gradually; external balances remain well anchored, leaving the capital account / confidence channel as the main macro vulnerability.

What is NEW in the last ~2 weeks (realised tape / narrative confirmation):

The macro debate has shifted decisively to trade policy and USMCA review risk as the dominant medium-term driver of growth and asset pricing.

Inflation dynamics remain uncomfortably sticky, reinforcing the case for a pause in the easing cycle despite a negative output gap.

Growth deceleration in 2025 is now broadly accepted as the baseline; attention has moved to whether 2026 recovery is fragile or merely low-trend.

What did NOT change:

The binding constraint remains core/services inflation + expectations, not headline volatility.

External balances (current account, trade, remittances) remain a stabilizer.

The policy mix remains cautious: monetary policy cannot aggressively insure growth without risking inflation credibility and FX pressure.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: sustained cooling in core/services inflation and expectations, allowing Banxico to ease further without destabilizing MXN or the rate differential.

Hawkish / defensive trigger: renewed inflation surprises (taxes, tariffs, wages) or MXN weakness tied to US policy shocks, forcing a longer pause.

External-policy shock trigger: adverse outcome in USMCA review materially weakening confidence, FDI, or portfolio flows.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (last ~2 weeks, HF take)

(No single high-frequency release in early Jan 2026 materially altered the structural outlook; the foundation regime is driven by accumulated 2025 data and forward-looking policy risks.)

Structural anchors confirmed by recent tape and expectations:

Growth slowed sharply in 2025 (real GDP ~0.3%), pushing the output gap into negative territory.

Core inflation deteriorated in 2025 and remains sticky, especially in services.

Inflation expectations have shown signs of drifting higher into 2026, ahead of tax/tariff and minimum-wage effects.

HF take: the absence of a “clean disinflation surprise” in the latest data justifies Banxico’s pause and reinforces the importance of forward-looking risks (trade, wages, tariffs).

Top-Down Macro — Framework

A) Growth / demand
Baseline (foundation outlook): real GDP growth is expected to firm from a very weak 0.3% in 2025 to a still below-trend ~1.3% in 2026 (third consecutive year below 1.5%).
Drivers:

Headwinds: restrictive past monetary stance, fiscal consolidation, soft business confidence, USMCA uncertainty, moderating job creation.

Supports: less restrictive policy stance than in 2024, resilient labour market, strong wage growth (including minimum wage increases), household consumption, and potential near-/friend-shoring FDI over the medium term.
HF interpretation: growth is weak but not collapsing; the output gap provides theoretical room for easing, but policy is constrained by inflation and external considerations.

B) Inflation / “last mile”
Baseline: inflation expected to re-accelerate to ~4.3% in 2026 from ~3.7% in 2025.
Drivers:

Normalization of non-core inflation from unusually low levels,

Cost-push pressures (double-digit minimum wage increase, tax/tariff hikes),

Sticky services inflation and deteriorating expectations,

Event-related demand pressures (e.g., FIFA World Cup effects on services).
HF interpretation: Mexico faces a cost-push + expectations problem, not a demand boom. This keeps Banxico cautious despite weak growth.

C) Monetary policy / reaction function
Baseline: Banxico cut the policy rate by 300bp in 2025 to 7.00%, moving policy from restrictive to the upper half of neutral.
Foundation outlook:

Near-term: pause in 1Q26 as inflation risks dominate.

Medium-term: additional 50bp of cuts expected before year-end (two 25bp moves), taking the policy rate to ~6.50% (broad neutrality).
Constraints:

Ex-ante real rate already near ~3.0%, within the estimated r* band.

Sticky core inflation and expected 1Q26 re-acceleration.

Tight Mexico–US rate differential limits room for aggressive easing.
HF interpretation: Banxico’s easing path is opportunistic, not linear.

D) Fiscal / credibility
Baseline: fiscal stance deteriorated sharply in 2024 (primary balance -1.5% of GDP), followed by partial consolidation in 2025 (~+0.2% of GDP) and a further modest adjustment expected in 2026.
Debt: public debt slightly above 50% of GDP — moderate by EM standards.
HF interpretation: Mexico benefits from relative fiscal discipline, but medium-term pressures remain. Fiscal policy is not the dominant near-term risk, but it does not provide a strong growth impulse either.

E) External accounts / buffers
Current account: well anchored, with rolling deficit near 0% of GDP and projected to remain below 1% of GDP in 2025–26.
Supports:

Large non-oil trade surplus,

Strong workers’ remittances,

Moderate FDI (~2.5% of GDP).
Risks: capital account vulnerability — portfolio flows have been negative since 2020 and remain sensitive to policy confidence and US relations.
HF interpretation: Mexico is more vulnerable to a confidence shock in capital flows than to a current-account blowout.

Binding constraint + next prints that matter
Binding constraint: core/services inflation + expectations under trade-policy uncertainty.
Next prints that matter most: core/services CPI momentum, inflation expectations, wage indicators, Banxico communication, and concrete signals on the USMCA review.

Central Bank — Last Meeting & Reaction Function

Last Central Bank Meeting — Banco de México (Banxico)
Meeting date: December 2025
Decision: CUT policy rate to 7.00% (culminating a cumulative 300bp easing in 2025)
Statement bias: cautious; emphasis on inflation risks and data dependence

Official rationale (condensed):

Policy stance moved closer to neutral after substantial easing.

Core inflation remains high and sticky; expectations warrant vigilance.

Future moves depend on inflation trajectory and external conditions.

Forward guidance (reaction-function language):

Near-term pause justified by inflation risks and US rate uncertainty.

Further easing possible only if inflation evolves in line with forecasts and FX remains orderly.

HF interpretation (foundation anchor):

Banxico is no longer “behind the curve” on growth; it is constrained by inflation credibility and external differentials.

The reaction function is asymmetric: easier to pause than to accelerate cuts if risks materialize.

Political / Trade Policy Outlook — FOUNDATION ANCHOR

USMCA Review: Review or Reset?
Nature of the risk: the USMCA review is a structural, medium-term risk for Mexico’s growth and investment outlook.
Baseline expectation: preservation of the spirit and trade preferences of USMCA, but with low confidence that a fully tri-partite agreement survives unchanged. A bilateral US–Mexico framework remains a plausible outcome.

Transmission channels:

Trade policy uncertainty → business confidence / FDI: delays investment decisions, caps growth.

Rules-of-origin / wage requirements tightening: raises costs, pressures inflation and competitiveness.

China-link scrutiny: potential negative for certain manufacturing and supply-chain segments.

Domestic policy backdrop:

State-centered policies in energy and mining, institutional quality concerns, and security issues weigh on medium-term FDI despite near-shoring potential.

Foundation conclusion (political/trade layer):
US relations and trade policy are first-order drivers of Mexico’s medium-term macro and market performance, more important than near-term fiscal or cyclical fluctuations.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution (foundation)

Rates:

Front-end anchored by a pause-biased easing cycle.

Volatility driven by inflation surprises and US rate expectations.

Tail: renewed inflation or US hawkishness delays further cuts.

MXN:

Structural support: anchored current account, remittances, trade surplus.

Structural drag: capital-account sensitivity, USMCA uncertainty, inflation expectations.

Trigger map:
• MXN-positive: benign USMCA outcome + easing inflation → gradual easing resumes.
• MXN-negative: adverse US policy shock or inflation re-acceleration → pause extended; FX bears the adjustment.

PM Self-Assessment (foundation quality): PASS as a regime anchor; subsequent live runs should focus on deltas vs this foundation.
