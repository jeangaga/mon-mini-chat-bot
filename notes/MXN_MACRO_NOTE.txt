MEXICO (MXN) MACRO — LIVE MONTH VIEW (JANUARY 2026)

STATUS: Live as of JAN 30 close

====================================================
FRAME (HOW TO TRADE THIS MONTH)

January flipped Mexico’s macro hierarchy from “carry + decent growth” to “carry with a growth break, and inflation finally giving Banxico room.”
So the month is a tug-of-war between:

Growth leg: IGAE → GDP flash = momentum broke (first-order for MXN beta)

Inflation leg: Dec CPI + Jan 1H CPI = disinflation/undershoot = Banxico constraint loosening

Carry leg: still high, but now conditional: the market starts asking whether carry is being paid enough for growth risk + policy pivot risk.

The correct MXN lens is rates-path credibility vs growth downside, not single prints.

====================================================
JAN 30 — RELEASED (REGIME SHIFT: GROWTH BREAK)
MEXICO — GDP Flash y/y (Q4)

Actual -0.1% vs Cons +1.3% vs Prior +1.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: this is a growth regime break, not noise. A contraction print vs a +1% handle consensus resets the narrative from “soft landing” to stall speed / recession tail. Secondary: the y/y miss matters for positioning because MXN longs have been structured as “high carry + stable macro.” This undermines the “stable” leg. Reaction function: Banxico doesn’t cut because of one GDP print, but it reweights the committee’s risk balance: growth downside becomes first-order once inflation is cooperative. Transmission: front-end rates rally (cuts become thinkable again, even if not priced); MXN downside through growth differential + risk beta, partially cushioned by carry.

MEXICO — GDP Flash q/q (Q4)

Actual -0.3% vs Cons +0.6% vs Prior +0.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal: sequential contraction confirms late-year momentum snapped. Secondary: market will now treat the next 4–6 weeks of activity prints as “trend confirmation.” If they come in soft, pricing can shift fast because the market’s baseline had been stability. Reaction function: strengthens the case for a pivot sequencing (hold while inflation confirms → then ease if growth remains weak). Transmission: bull-flattening at the front-end; MXN more sensitive to risk-off shocks.

====================================================
JAN 23 — RELEASED (EARLY WARNING CONFIRMED)
MEXICO — IGAE Economic Activity y/y (Nov)

Actual -0.1% vs Cons +1.0% vs Prior +1.7%
HF comment: Dominant signal: this was the leading indicator of the GDP miss. A negative print vs +1% consensus is a broad slowdown signal, not a sector quirk. Secondary: Mexico’s growth is unusually sensitive to external manufacturing demand and domestic credit conditions; this fits a “manufacturing drag + tighter real rates” mix. Reaction function: increases Banxico’s confidence that restrictive policy is biting — making the committee more willing to entertain easing once inflation allows. Transmission: rates supportive; MXN negative on growth surprise but not capitulation due to carry.

====================================================
JAN 22 — RELEASED (INFLATION CONSTRAINT LOOSENS)
MEXICO — 1st Half-Month CPI m/m (Jan)

Actual 0.31% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.17%
HF comment: Dominant signal: clean undershoot — this is the type of inflation print that creates policy space, especially when growth is rolling. Secondary: because it’s an early-month print, it influences how the market sets expectations for the full-month inflation path. It’s not definitive, but it moves the reaction function. Reaction function: materially loosens the inflation constraint; Banxico can now shift tone from “restrictive for as long as needed” to “restrictive, but watching growth.” Transmission: front-end rates rally; MXN can initially hold up (real-rate still high), but medium-term FX depends on whether the market begins to price a faster easing cycle.

MEXICO — 1st Half-Month Core CPI m/m (Jan)

Actual 0.43% vs Cons 0.44% vs Prior 0.31%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core is not collapsing, but it didn’t re-accelerate, which matters more than the level. Secondary: stickiness here implies Banxico will still want sequencing and confirmation (avoid an early victory declaration). Reaction function: supports measured easing optionality, not an aggressive pivot. Transmission: limits the size of dovish repricing; MXN remains supported by carry.

====================================================
JAN 9 — RELEASED (HARD ACTIVITY: INDUSTRIAL DRAG)
MEXICO — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)

Actual -0.8% vs Cons -1.2% vs Prior -0.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal: industry still contracting. “Less bad than feared” is not bullish when the trend is negative — it’s just a smaller downside surprise. Secondary: aligns with the PMI contraction and points to weak external manufacturing impulse. Reaction function: adds weight to growth downside but doesn’t change Banxico alone. Transmission: rates supportive; MXN direction depends on global risk and US cycle.

MEXICO — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)

Actual +0.6% vs Cons 0.0% vs Prior +0.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal: monthly bounce is noise unless it turns into a sequence. With y/y still negative, this is not a regime change. Reaction function: negligible. Transmission: limited.

====================================================
JAN 8 — RELEASED (DISINFLATION CONFIRMS)
MEXICO — Headline CPI m/m (Dec)

Actual 0.28% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.66%
HF comment: Dominant signal: decisive downside surprise — disinflation regained traction. Secondary: even if components helped (food/energy), the macro point is that inflation is no longer binding. Reaction function: this is a key precondition for later easing; it shifts the balance of risks toward growth. Transmission: rates bullish; MXN supported initially by the real-rate story but becomes more sensitive to the “Banxico can ease” narrative later.

MEXICO — Core CPI m/m (Dec)

Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.42% vs Prior 0.19%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core stable and not alarming. Secondary: the jump vs prior keeps Banxico cautious; it says “progress, not victory.” Reaction function: keeps sequencing slow. Transmission: modest.

MEXICO — CPI y/y (Dec)

Actual 3.69% vs Cons 3.80% vs Prior 3.80%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation is back into a zone where Banxico can credibly say “restrictive stance is working.” Secondary: this is what turns growth weakness into a policy-relevant problem. Reaction function: inflation constraint relaxes. Transmission: supports rates; MXN impact depends on path expectations.

MEXICO — PPI m/m (Dec)

Actual 0.4% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: pipeline not pressuring CPI; second-order supportive.

MEXICO — PPI y/y (Dec)

Actual 2.4% vs Prior 2.1%
HF comment: mild firming but not binding; limited.

====================================================
JAN 7 — RELEASED (CONTEXT)
MEXICO — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)

Actual 4.29 vs Prior 4.30
HF comment: no catalyst. Confirms MXN is not trading idiosyncratic stress; it’s trading macro path + global risk.

====================================================
JAN 2 — RELEASED (SURVEY BASELINE)
MEXICO — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec)

Actual 47.3 vs Cons 46.1
HF comment: Dominant signal: contraction persists. “Less bad than feared” doesn’t change that sub-50 is a weak manufacturing pulse. Secondary: consistent with subsequent industrial and activity weakness. Reaction function: supports growth-downside narrative but only as a confirming indicator. Transmission: mild rates support; FX impact via risk tone.

====================================================
MONTH SYNTHESIS — MXN (JANUARY 2026)
What actually mattered

1) Growth broke. IGAE and GDP flash together forced a reset: Mexico is not “stable growth with high carry” anymore.
2) Inflation stopped being the constraint. December CPI and January half-month CPI gave Banxico room.
3) The market’s MXN framework must shift from “carry is enough” to “carry must compensate for growth + pivot risk.”

What did not

PMI alone (it mattered only because hard data confirmed it).

PPI (secondary signal).

Risk score update (context only).

Reaction function (Banxico) — what changed

Before: inflation management dominated; growth weakness was tolerated.

After January: inflation is cooperative → growth becomes first-order, so Banxico’s communication and sequencing turn more sensitive to downside data.

MXN tradeable regime (end-Jan)

Near-term support: still-high real rates + credibility.

Medium-term risk: if weakness persists, the market will start to price a faster easing path, turning MXN from “carry darling” into “carry with policy pivot risk.”

Asymmetry: MXN now has fatter left tail in risk-off, because growth deterioration reduces the cushion that high carry usually provides.

MXN Macro Note — FOUNDATION (Mexico)
Date: 19 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Scope: Foundational regime anchor + reaction-function map
Primary window (last ~2 weeks of realised macro tape): early–mid Jan 2026 (no major high-frequency surprises overriding the structural frame)
Rolling perspective (anchors & structural constraints): past ~3–12 months

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

FOUNDATION REGIME (define the state of the world):
Mexico is in a “trade–policy–inflation tension” regime where weak growth, sticky core/services inflation, and a tight Mexico–US rate differential constrain monetary easing, while USMCA uncertainty and domestic institutional policy choices dominate medium-term risk premia. Fiscal consolidation is proceeding, but only gradually; external balances remain well anchored, leaving the capital account / confidence channel as the main macro vulnerability.

What is NEW in the last ~2 weeks (realised tape / narrative confirmation):

The macro debate has shifted decisively to trade policy and USMCA review risk as the dominant medium-term driver of growth and asset pricing.

Inflation dynamics remain uncomfortably sticky, reinforcing the case for a pause in the easing cycle despite a negative output gap.

Growth deceleration in 2025 is now broadly accepted as the baseline; attention has moved to whether 2026 recovery is fragile or merely low-trend.

What did NOT change:

The binding constraint remains core/services inflation + expectations, not headline volatility.

External balances (current account, trade, remittances) remain a stabilizer.

The policy mix remains cautious: monetary policy cannot aggressively insure growth without risking inflation credibility and FX pressure.

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: sustained cooling in core/services inflation and expectations, allowing Banxico to ease further without destabilizing MXN or the rate differential.

Hawkish / defensive trigger: renewed inflation surprises (taxes, tariffs, wages) or MXN weakness tied to US policy shocks, forcing a longer pause.

External-policy shock trigger: adverse outcome in USMCA review materially weakening confidence, FDI, or portfolio flows.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (last ~2 weeks, HF take)

(No single high-frequency release in early Jan 2026 materially altered the structural outlook; the foundation regime is driven by accumulated 2025 data and forward-looking policy risks.)

Structural anchors confirmed by recent tape and expectations:

Growth slowed sharply in 2025 (real GDP ~0.3%), pushing the output gap into negative territory.

Core inflation deteriorated in 2025 and remains sticky, especially in services.

Inflation expectations have shown signs of drifting higher into 2026, ahead of tax/tariff and minimum-wage effects.

HF take: the absence of a “clean disinflation surprise” in the latest data justifies Banxico’s pause and reinforces the importance of forward-looking risks (trade, wages, tariffs).

Top-Down Macro — Framework

A) Growth / demand
Baseline (foundation outlook): real GDP growth is expected to firm from a very weak 0.3% in 2025 to a still below-trend ~1.3% in 2026 (third consecutive year below 1.5%).
Drivers:

Headwinds: restrictive past monetary stance, fiscal consolidation, soft business confidence, USMCA uncertainty, moderating job creation.

Supports: less restrictive policy stance than in 2024, resilient labour market, strong wage growth (including minimum wage increases), household consumption, and potential near-/friend-shoring FDI over the medium term.
HF interpretation: growth is weak but not collapsing; the output gap provides theoretical room for easing, but policy is constrained by inflation and external considerations.

B) Inflation / “last mile”
Baseline: inflation expected to re-accelerate to ~4.3% in 2026 from ~3.7% in 2025.
Drivers:

Normalization of non-core inflation from unusually low levels,

Cost-push pressures (double-digit minimum wage increase, tax/tariff hikes),

Sticky services inflation and deteriorating expectations,

Event-related demand pressures (e.g., FIFA World Cup effects on services).
HF interpretation: Mexico faces a cost-push + expectations problem, not a demand boom. This keeps Banxico cautious despite weak growth.

C) Monetary policy / reaction function
Baseline: Banxico cut the policy rate by 300bp in 2025 to 7.00%, moving policy from restrictive to the upper half of neutral.
Foundation outlook:

Near-term: pause in 1Q26 as inflation risks dominate.

Medium-term: additional 50bp of cuts expected before year-end (two 25bp moves), taking the policy rate to ~6.50% (broad neutrality).
Constraints:

Ex-ante real rate already near ~3.0%, within the estimated r* band.

Sticky core inflation and expected 1Q26 re-acceleration.

Tight Mexico–US rate differential limits room for aggressive easing.
HF interpretation: Banxico’s easing path is opportunistic, not linear.

D) Fiscal / credibility
Baseline: fiscal stance deteriorated sharply in 2024 (primary balance -1.5% of GDP), followed by partial consolidation in 2025 (~+0.2% of GDP) and a further modest adjustment expected in 2026.
Debt: public debt slightly above 50% of GDP — moderate by EM standards.
HF interpretation: Mexico benefits from relative fiscal discipline, but medium-term pressures remain. Fiscal policy is not the dominant near-term risk, but it does not provide a strong growth impulse either.

E) External accounts / buffers
Current account: well anchored, with rolling deficit near 0% of GDP and projected to remain below 1% of GDP in 2025–26.
Supports:

Large non-oil trade surplus,

Strong workers’ remittances,

Moderate FDI (~2.5% of GDP).
Risks: capital account vulnerability — portfolio flows have been negative since 2020 and remain sensitive to policy confidence and US relations.
HF interpretation: Mexico is more vulnerable to a confidence shock in capital flows than to a current-account blowout.

Binding constraint + next prints that matter
Binding constraint: core/services inflation + expectations under trade-policy uncertainty.
Next prints that matter most: core/services CPI momentum, inflation expectations, wage indicators, Banxico communication, and concrete signals on the USMCA review.

Central Bank — Last Meeting & Reaction Function

Last Central Bank Meeting — Banco de México (Banxico)
Meeting date: December 2025
Decision: CUT policy rate to 7.00% (culminating a cumulative 300bp easing in 2025)
Statement bias: cautious; emphasis on inflation risks and data dependence

Official rationale (condensed):

Policy stance moved closer to neutral after substantial easing.

Core inflation remains high and sticky; expectations warrant vigilance.

Future moves depend on inflation trajectory and external conditions.

Forward guidance (reaction-function language):

Near-term pause justified by inflation risks and US rate uncertainty.

Further easing possible only if inflation evolves in line with forecasts and FX remains orderly.

HF interpretation (foundation anchor):

Banxico is no longer “behind the curve” on growth; it is constrained by inflation credibility and external differentials.

The reaction function is asymmetric: easier to pause than to accelerate cuts if risks materialize.

Political / Trade Policy Outlook — FOUNDATION ANCHOR

USMCA Review: Review or Reset?
Nature of the risk: the USMCA review is a structural, medium-term risk for Mexico’s growth and investment outlook.
Baseline expectation: preservation of the spirit and trade preferences of USMCA, but with low confidence that a fully tri-partite agreement survives unchanged. A bilateral US–Mexico framework remains a plausible outcome.

Transmission channels:

Trade policy uncertainty → business confidence / FDI: delays investment decisions, caps growth.

Rules-of-origin / wage requirements tightening: raises costs, pressures inflation and competitiveness.

China-link scrutiny: potential negative for certain manufacturing and supply-chain segments.

Domestic policy backdrop:

State-centered policies in energy and mining, institutional quality concerns, and security issues weigh on medium-term FDI despite near-shoring potential.

Foundation conclusion (political/trade layer):
US relations and trade policy are first-order drivers of Mexico’s medium-term macro and market performance, more important than near-term fiscal or cyclical fluctuations.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution (foundation)

Rates:

Front-end anchored by a pause-biased easing cycle.

Volatility driven by inflation surprises and US rate expectations.

Tail: renewed inflation or US hawkishness delays further cuts.

MXN:

Structural support: anchored current account, remittances, trade surplus.

Structural drag: capital-account sensitivity, USMCA uncertainty, inflation expectations.

Trigger map:
• MXN-positive: benign USMCA outcome + easing inflation → gradual easing resumes.
• MXN-negative: adverse US policy shock or inflation re-acceleration → pause extended; FX bears the adjustment.

PM Self-Assessment (foundation quality): PASS as a regime anchor; subsequent live runs should focus on deltas vs this foundation.
