  "comment": "SPX is consolidating just below recent highs, holding above the 6,700 area within a broader rising channel. Bulls still control the medium-term trend, but the loss of momentum and repeated tests of support keep the near-term bias closer to neutral, with 6,700–6,800 as key support and 6,900–7,000 as the main resistance zone to watch."
