DATA RELEASES BY DAY
SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9
Japan — Current Account (Dec) — 00:50 JST

NSA: ¥728.8B vs ¥1,060.4B poll | Prior: ¥3,674.1B
SA: ¥2,697.1B | Prior: ¥3,137.8B
Trade Balance SA: ¥56.2B | Prior: ¥450.7B

Commentary: Current account declined sharply with NSA at ¥728.8B (vs ¥1,060B poll, -31% miss) and SA balance fell to ¥2,697B from ¥3,138B (-¥440B). However, trade balance on customs basis improved to ¥56B from ¥451B. Full year 2025: record current account surplus driven by primary income at an all-time high of ¥41.59T from overseas investments; dividends from foreign subsidiaries up 4.7%. Exports +2.5% to ¥107.76T led by semiconductors/electronic components; US exports fell for first time in 5 years (-4.1% to ¥20.4T) with autos (-11.4%) and auto parts (-10.7%), consistent with tariff drag, offset by Asia/Europe strength.

HF Take: December miss looks flow/timing-heavy rather than competitiveness-driven. Trade improving while the overall CA softens points to primary/secondary income volatility more than goods deterioration. Japan’s external position remains fundamentally solid and increasingly income-led (decades of overseas asset accumulation) rather than trade-led. Bilateral US tariff pressure is visible in autos/parts, but diversification is doing its job. Policy relevance for BoJ remains limited: external accounts are not the constraint; domestic wages/inflation are.

New Zealand — Reserve Assets (Jan) — 03:00 NZDT

Total: $51,186M | Prior: $48,654M

Commentary: Reserve assets rose ~$2.5B to $51.2B from $48.7B.

HF Take: Likely reflects either smoothing FX volatility or routine balance-of-payments accumulation. Not a policy signal by itself, but confirms adequate intervention capacity if NZD volatility rises.

Norway — GDP (Q4) — 08:00 CET

Headline QoQ: -0.3% | Prior: +1.1% (rev +1.3%)
Mainland QoQ: +0.4% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.1%
Mainland MoM (Dec): 0.0% | Prior: -0.4%

Commentary: Headline contraction (-0.3%) is oil/gas-sector dominated; mainland GDP (domestic demand proxy) held at +0.4% QoQ (as expected), while December momentum was flat (0.0% m/m). Divergence is consistent with North Sea production/maintenance volatility rather than broad domestic weakness.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): Policy mapping hinges on mainland not headline. +0.4% QoQ keeps the domestic activity picture intact but is not an overheating signal; the 0.0% m/m into year-end matters because it argues against a demand-led inflation story. JGM Take (flag): base case is cuts delayed / fewer cuts, not hikes — unless inflation persistence is confirmed by follow-through (see CPI). The reaction function is gated by whether inflation strength is “services/wage persistence” rather than growth acceleration.

Eurozone — Sentix Investor Confidence (Feb) — 10:30 CET

Index: +4.2 vs 0.0 poll | Prior: -1.8

Commentary: A sharp rebound (+6 points) into positive territory. Early-month timing often captures positioning/expectations shifts quickly, but needs hard-data validation.

HF Take: Treat as “signal, not evidence.” It can be consistent with hopes around German fiscal posture and/or global stabilization narratives, but Thursday GDP flash is the real test. If GDP prints ≥ +0.3% QoQ, sentiment looks prescient; if not, this is fragile optimism. EUR implications remain conditional on GDP.

Mexico — Inflation (Jan) — 13:00 CST

Headline MoM: +0.38% vs +0.41% poll | Prior: +0.28%
Core MoM: +0.60% vs +0.59% poll | Prior: +0.41%
YoY: +3.79% vs +3.82% poll | Prior: +3.69%

Commentary: Headline 3.79% YoY slightly below consensus and still inside Banxico’s 2–4% tolerance band, but core momentum re-accelerated materially (0.60% m/m vs 0.41% prior). Sector detail: services inflation remains the pressure point (7.68% y/y) with broad stickiness (street food/restaurants, mobile services, car maintenance, medical consults, tourism). Other elevated categories include healthcare/personal care (5.37%) and food/bev/tobacco (4.43%). Banxico backdrop: recent vote split (4–1 with Heath dissent) underscores internal debate on persistence vs easing.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): Headline being “fine” is not the constraint — core momentum is. One more 0.6% print makes a “mechanical cut path” hard to defend; reversion back toward 0.3–0.4% m/m restores the May-cut baseline. The market’s easing path is now explicitly conditional on services cooling — not on headline being in range.

Mexico — PPI (Jan) — 13:00 CST

MoM: +0.2% | Prior: +0.5%
YoY: +1.5% | Prior: +2.1%

Commentary: Pipeline pressures eased on the producer side.

HF Take: This reinforces the services-vs-goods split: PPI is not the driver of the current core problem. Goods pipeline disinflation doesn’t solve sticky service pricing power.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10
Japan — Money Supply (00:50 JST)

M2: ¥1,282.1T | Prior: ¥1,281.7T (rev)
Broad Money: ¥2,244.9T | Prior: ¥2,244.7T (rev)

Commentary: Marginal increase.

HF Take: No signal beyond “steady/low-vol” money dynamics. Limited credit impulse; BoJ stance unchanged.

Sweden — Industrial Production (Dec) — 08:00 CET

Private Production YoY: +4.2% | Prior: +3.2% (rev)
Private Production MoM: +1.6% | Prior: +0.2% (rev)
Industrial Production YoY: +4.2% | Prior: +3.1% (rev)
Industrial Production MoM: +5.1% | Prior: -0.3% (rev)

Commentary: Very strong sequential rebound; YoY also improved.

HF Take: +5.1% m/m is likely noisy (seasonal/one-offs/restocking) but the YoY firming argues there is at least some underlying resilience. Watch Q1 prints for confirmation; if persistent, Sweden diverges modestly from the eurozone industrial malaise and can reduce the urgency of additional easing.

Norway — CPI (Jan) — 08:00 CET ⚠️

Headline YoY: +3.6% vs +3.1% poll | Prior: +3.2%
Headline MoM: +0.6% | Prior: +0.1%
Core YoY: +3.4% vs +3.0% poll | Prior: +3.1%
Core MoM: +0.3% vs -0.1% poll | Prior: +0.1%

Commentary: Upside shock across the board: headline +50bp vs poll, core +40bp vs poll, and core m/m +0.3% vs -0.1% expected (the most policy-relevant element). Category color in the baseline: housing/utilities 4.3% (from 3.9%), transport 4.4% (from 2.7%), restaurants/accommodation 5.8% (from 5.1%), food cooled to 4.2% (from 5.3%). Labor market cooling signal exists (vacancies down 5.1% QoQ to 85k in Q4). Norges Bank messaging pre-print: core inflation around 3% since autumn 2024 “for a fairly long period.” Post-print: several banks moved toward fewer/delayed cuts; Nomura notably shifted to one cut late-2026.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): This is cuts repricing, not a hiking pivot. The core m/m miss (+0.3 vs -0.1) is the key: it argues breadth/persistence risk, not just a headline wobble. JGM Take (flag): January composition likely amplified by rent dynamics (large effective contribution inside the core basket), and seasonal discounting in clothing/furniture being less aggressive than typical — making this a policy-relevant persistence test ahead of wage negotiations. If February doesn’t mean-revert, a June cut becomes difficult to justify; base case becomes “cuts delayed / fewer cuts.” NOK support is via front-end repricing and DM divergence vs EUR.

Brazil — IPCA (Jan) — 13:00 BRT

MoM: +0.33% vs +0.32% poll | Prior: +0.33%
YoY: +4.44% vs +4.43% poll | Prior: +4.26%

Commentary: YoY drifted up near the upper tolerance boundary.

HF Take: At 4.44%, Brazil is ~6bp from the top of the tolerance band (4.5%). The “optional” easing narrative is fragile: staying below 4.5 preserves flexibility; a breach forces a harder stance. (This is the gating logic, not tomorrow’s decision.)

United States — Import Prices (Dec) — 14:30 EST

YoY: 0.0% | Prior: -0.1% (rev)
MoM: +0.1% vs +0.1% poll | Prior: +0.4%

Commentary: External price impulse remains benign.

HF Take: Supports the “goods disinflation still present” narrative into CPI. With imports flat YoY, inflation risk concentrates in domestic services/wages and shelter.

United States — Retail Sales (Dec) — 14:30 EST ⚠️

Headline MoM: 0.0% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.6%
Ex-Autos MoM: 0.0% vs +0.3% poll | Prior: +0.4% (rev)
Retail Control: -0.1% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.2% (rev)

Commentary: Consumer spending decelerated into year-end: headline flat vs +0.4% expected; control group contracted -0.1% vs +0.4% expected (large miss for a typically stable GDP-relevant series). Revisions worsened the run-rate. Micro read-through (as provided in the baseline): five-week window ending Jan 3 showed revenue flat, unit demand -1%; discretionary merchandise dollars -2% with units -5%; food/beverage +2% dollars with units flat. Behavioral indicators: impulse buying <20% across most categories (record low), and new-product penetration ~2% vs ~5% historical norm.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): This is demand-quality erosion, not just a weather/one-off print. The control group miss (-0.1 vs +0.4) directly drags Q1 consumption tracking and reinforces that the “average” is deteriorating (not a single-category story).
JGM Take (flag — keep explicit arithmetic): the key macro signal is the constraint. Control group running ~+1.9% y/y in real terms (cyclical low), implying the consumption engine has already downshifted. Q4 real consumption likely around ~2.5% vs 3%+ in prior pace. That resilience was financed by buffer drawdown: personal saving rate pushed down to ~3.5% (Nov) — roughly a ~19-year low — which is hard to repeat if confidence is softening and the labor market cools at the margin. Mechanically, consumption growth must converge toward real income growth, i.e., roughly ~1.5% real in baseline conditions (even if refunds smooth near-term optics).
Policy mapping: this materially increases Fed optionality, but CPI composition still gates timing.

United States — Employment Cost Index (Q4) — 14:30 EST

QoQ: +0.7% vs +0.8% poll | Prior: +0.8%

Commentary: Broad compensation growth cooled further; private compensation running ~3.4% y/y in the baseline narrative.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): Directionally consistent with gradual cooling in wage pressure and reduced wage-price spiral risk. JGM Take (flag): level matters — ~3.4% y/y sits nearer the “tolerable” zone for the Fed; even allowing for residual seasonality, the direction argues against re-acceleration. The joint signal with retail (control weak + ECI cooling) supports “how soon can we ease” becoming the debate — but CPI remains the gating print.

United States — Business Inventories (Nov) — 16:00 EST

MoM: +0.1% vs +0.2% poll | Prior: +0.2% (rev)

Commentary: Slower accumulation.

HF Take: Neutral-to-slightly supportive for near-term growth stability; not the swing factor this week.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11
China — CPI/PPI (Jan) — 02:30 Beijing

CPI YoY: +0.2% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.8%
CPI MoM: +0.2% vs +0.3% poll | Prior: +0.2%
PPI YoY: -1.4% vs -1.5% poll | Prior: -1.9%

Commentary: CPI undershot by 20bp (0.2 vs 0.4) with a small MoM miss; PPI improved (less negative) to -1.4% vs -1.9% prior.

HF Take (incl. JGM Take): Keep layers separate: base effects matter, but the MoM miss is the key “momentum” tell. JGM Take (flag): this is stabilization at low levels, not reflation. Lunar New Year timing can distort YoY, but sequential softness keeps the “demand still soft” narrative alive (housing subdued, job creation/wage growth contained). PPI narrowing is industrial stabilization (raw materials / non-ferrous sensitivity), not a domestic demand revival. Market implication: disinflation impulse remains; risk-off only if subsequent activity confirms deeper weakness or policy credibility slips. Immediate gating: whether policy response (PBOC + fiscal coordination) follows through in coming weeks.

Italy — Industrial Output (Dec) — 10:00 CET

MoM SA: -0.4% vs -0.5% poll | Prior: +1.5%
YoY WDA: +3.2% | Prior: +1.4%

Commentary: Sequential payback after a strong prior month, but less negative than feared; YoY improved.

HF Take: MoM is consistent with volatility/normalization after +1.5% prior; YoY strength likely helped by base effects. Not a March-ECB mover by itself, but useful context into Thursday GDP: if GDP surprises firmer, this fits the “stabilization” mosaic; if GDP disappoints, this reads as local noise.

Mexico — Industrial Production (Dec) — 13:00 CST

MoM: +0.2% vs -0.2% poll | Prior: +0.6%
YoY: +2.4% vs +1.3% poll | Prior: -0.8% (rev -0.7%)

Commentary: Solid upside surprise on both MoM and YoY; YoY swing large vs prior.

HF Take: This is an important “activity vs inflation” split: production is improving while core services inflation remains sticky. It supports the view that export/nearshoring-linked activity can coexist with constrained domestic demand. For Banxico, this doesn’t loosen the constraint — inflation momentum does.

United States — Employment Report (Jan) — 14:30 EST ⚠️

Non-Farm Payrolls: +130k vs +70k poll | Prior: +50k (rev +48k)
Private Payrolls: +172k vs +70k poll | Prior: +37k (rev +64k)
Unemployment Rate: 4.3% vs 4.4% poll | Prior: 4.4%
Avg Earnings MoM: +0.4% vs +0.3% poll | Prior: +0.3%
Avg Earnings YoY: +3.7% vs +3.6% poll | Prior: +3.8% (rev +3.7%)
Avg Workweek: 34.3 vs 34.2 poll | Prior: 34.2
Official release confirms the headline set.

Commentary: Headline payrolls beat; private payrolls beat by more; unemployment ticked down; wage growth was firmer on the month; hours worked edged up.

HF Take (incl. JGM-style framing): This shifts the US from “clean dovish” to mixed: consumption prints weak, but labor is not rolling over. The quality signal is the private payroll beat (+172k) plus upward revision in prior private (37 → 64k). Wages at +0.4% m/m keeps the inflation gating logic alive.
Reaction-function mapping: this reduces urgency for an immediate cut unless CPI prints soft. In other words: Thursday CPI is now even more binary — (soft CPI → cuts still live despite strong labor; firm CPI → hold becomes dominant). Market narrative will likely pivot to “no landing vs soft landing” depending on CPI composition (shelter and core services ex-shelter).

Canada — Building Permits (Dec) — 14:30 EST

MoM: +6.8% vs +5.0% poll | Prior: -13.1% (rev -13.2%)

Commentary: Rebound after a sharp prior drop; still volatile series.

HF Take: Partial normalization after an extreme prior decline; not a BoC driver in isolation. Use as color into broader housing sensitivity rather than a trend signal.

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12 [UPCOMING]
Japan — Corp Goods Prices (00:50 JST)

Poll: +0.2% MoM, +2.3% YoY (Prior: +0.1%, +2.4%)

Context: Producer-price trajectory; watch whether pass-through is fading.

South Africa — Mining Production (10:30 SAST)

Prior: -2.7% YoY

Context: Commodity/EM activity pulse.

South Africa — Manufacturing Production (12:00 SAST)

Prior: -1.1% MoM

Context: EM production trend confirmation.

Brazil — Service Sector Growth (13:00 BRT)

Prior: -0.1% MoM

Context: Services momentum vs inflation constraint.

United States — Initial Jobless Claims (14:30 EST)

Poll: 222k (Prior: 231k)

Key Watch: Any break above ~250k would matter; otherwise “steady labor” narrative persists.

United States — Existing Home Sales (16:00 EST)

Poll: 4.35M (Prior: 4.18M)

Key Watch: Confirmation of stabilization vs still-rate-capped demand.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13 [UPCOMING] — MAJOR EVENT DAY
Eurozone — GDP Flash (11:00 CET) 🔴

Poll: +0.3% QoQ, +1.3% YoY

Key Watch: Confirms/refutes Sentix rebound; shapes the slope of ECB cuts beyond March.

United States — CPI (14:30 EST) 🔴🔴 WEEK’S MAIN EVENT

Poll: Core +0.3% MoM / +2.5% YoY; Headline +0.3% MoM / +2.5% YoY

Scenarios (keep it trading-floor tight, but explicit):

Core ≤0.2% m/m: disinflation re-asserts; despite strong NFP, cuts re-enter front-end pricing materially.

Core ~0.25–0.35%: “mixed” holds; Fed stays patient, timing pushed later unless subsequent activity deteriorates.

Core ≥0.4%: strong NFP + firm CPI = higher-for-longer reinforced; USD bid, front-end sells off.

Key components to watch: shelter (rate-of-change), core services ex-shelter (wage-to-price transmission), used cars (noise but can swing), breadth (how many categories running hot).

CROSS-ASSET THEMES & POSITIONING
Theme 1: US = Mixed Macro (Consumption Weak, Labor Firm)

Evidence: Retail control -0.1% (big GDP-relevant miss) + ECI cooling vs NFP beat (+130k) and earnings +0.4% m/m.
JGM Take (flag): the consumption arithmetic constraint is binding: real control ~+1.9% y/y, saving rate ~3.5% (~19y low), forcing convergence of consumption growth toward ~1.5% real income growth.
Catalyst: Thursday CPI decides whether the market trades “soft landing with cuts” or “no landing / higher for longer.”
Positioning: reduce binary exposure into CPI; express views through convexity (rates/FX). Front-end longs only if CPI confirms; USD shorts conditional.

Theme 2: Norway = DM Divergence via Cuts Repricing

Evidence: CPI 3.6 vs 3.1; core 3.4 vs 3.0; core m/m +0.3 vs -0.1.
JGM Take (flag): rent/seasonal discount dynamics likely amplified Jan, but persistence test is real; if Feb doesn’t reverse, June easing gets hard to defend.
Positioning: NOK supported vs EUR on relative path; front-end NOK supported by delayed cuts.

Theme 3: China = Low-Level Stabilization, Not Reflation

Evidence: CPI 0.2 vs 0.4; PPI less negative (-1.4).
JGM Take (flag): base effects matter but sequential weakness keeps demand concerns alive; PPI narrowing = industrial stabilization not domestic revival.
Positioning: stay defensive unless stimulus is delivered (not just signaled); watch EM Asia spillovers.

Theme 4: EM CB Constraints (Mexico & Brazil)

Evidence: Mexico core momentum 0.60% m/m with sticky services; Brazil 4.44% near 4.5% ceiling.
Positioning: MXN supported by carry but vulnerable if pause extends; BRL tail risk if ceiling breached.

Theme 5: Eurozone = Validation Day (GDP Flash)

Evidence: Sentix bounce vs need for hard-data confirmation.
Positioning: EUR constructive only if GDP validates; otherwise fade optimism.

UPDATED WEEK OUTLOOK

Narrative evolution:

Pre-Tue: retail + ECI skewed dovish.

Post-Tue: NFP strength re-injects “Fed patience” unless CPI prints convincingly soft.

Key remaining gating events: EZ GDP + US CPI (Thursday).

Working base case (until CPI): mixed growth/inflation signals → reduce conviction trades; keep scenario map tight; let CPI decide.

JGM AUDIT SUMMARY
