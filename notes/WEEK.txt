## DATA RELEASES BY DAY

### **SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9**

#### **Japan - Current Account (Dec) - 00:50 JST**
**NSA:** ¥728.8B vs ¥1,060.4B poll | Prior: ¥3,674.1B  
**SA:** ¥2,697.1B | Prior: ¥3,137.8B  
**Trade Balance SA:** ¥56.2B | Prior: ¥450.7B

**Commentary:** Current account declined sharply with NSA at ¥728.8B (vs ¥1,060B poll, -31% miss) and SA balance fell to ¥2,697B from ¥3,138B (-¥440B). However, trade balance on customs basis improved dramatically to ¥56B from ¥451B, suggesting merchandise trade stabilizing. Full year 2025 saw record current account surplus driven by primary income reaching all-time high of ¥41.59T from overseas investments - dividends from foreign subsidiaries of Japanese firms up 4.7%. Exports increased 2.5% to ¥107.76T led by semiconductors and electronic components, though US exports dropped for first time in 5 years (-4.1% to ¥20.4T) due to Trump tariffs hitting autos (-11.4%) and auto parts (-10.7%). Strong exports to Asia and Europe offset US weakness.

**HF Take:** The December miss masks compositional strength. Trade balance improving while overall current account weak indicates income/transfer flow volatility rather than export competitiveness deterioration. Japan's external position remains solid at 4.6% of GDP in H1 2025 (projected 4.4% for full year 2025, 4.1% for 2026) supported by investment income, not goods trade. This structural shift - from trade surplus to investment income surplus - is sustainable and reflects decades of overseas asset accumulation. US tariff impact on autos visible but contained; diversification to Asia/EU working. BoJ will view this as neutral for policy - external position healthy despite bilateral US friction.

#### **New Zealand - Reserve Assets (Jan) - 03:00 NZDT**
**Total:** $51,186M | Prior: $48,654M

**Commentary:** Reserve assets increased $2.5B to $51.2B from $48.7B.

**HF Take:** Build likely reflects FX intervention to manage NZD volatility or natural accumulation from export receipts. Not a major policy signal but indicates RBNZ maintaining adequate reserves amid global volatility. With RBNZ on hold, reserves at comfortable levels for intervention if needed.

---

#### **Norway - GDP (Q4) - 08:00 CET**
**Headline QoQ:** -0.3% | Prior: +1.1% (rev +1.3%)  
**Mainland QoQ:** +0.4% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.1% (rev +0.1%)  
**Mainland MoM (Dec):** 0.0% | Prior: -0.4%

**Commentary:** Sharp headline contraction (-0.3% vs +1.3% revised prior) entirely oil/gas sector driven. Mainland economy (excluding oil/gas, the domestic demand proxy) grew as expected at +0.4% QoQ, though December monthly data flatlined at 0.0% vs -0.4% prior. Norges Bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache emphasized in January statement that "restrictive monetary policy is still needed. Inflation is still too high." The unusual divergence reflects North Sea production disruptions or maintenance schedules while real economy holds up.

**HF Take:** Norges Bank will look through headline volatility and focus on mainland GDP for policy - the +0.4% print keeps them on gradual easing path outlined in December (1-2 cuts in 2026). However, the December momentum loss (0.0% MoM) is concerning as it shows the real economy stalling into year-end. When combined with Monday's inflation data (see below), this creates a complex picture: growth moderating but inflation accelerating. Policy implications to be determined by inflation trajectory.

---

#### **Eurozone - Sentix Investor Confidence (Feb) - 10:30 CET**
**Index:** +4.2 vs 0.0 poll | Prior: -1.8

**Commentary:** Sharp 6-point rebound moving into positive territory (+4.2 from -1.8), beating flat consensus. Early-month survey capturing fresh 2026 positioning.

**HF Take:** Could reflect German fiscal stimulus expectations or China stabilization hopes. Sentix is a leading indicator but needs confirmation from hard data. Thursday's GDP flash (Q4 expected +0.3% QoQ, +1.3% YoY) will validate or refute this optimism. If GDP confirms, EUR supportive; if misses, this was false hope. Treat as tentative signal pending real activity data.

---

#### **Mexico - Inflation (Jan) - 13:00 CST**
**Headline MoM:** +0.38% vs +0.41% poll | Prior: +0.28%  
**Core MoM:** +0.60% vs +0.59% poll | Prior: +0.41%  
**12-Month YoY:** +3.79% vs +3.82% poll | Prior: +3.69%

**Commentary:** Headline came slightly below expectations at 3.79% YoY (vs 3.82% poll), remaining within Banxico's 2-4% tolerance band, but core accelerated sharply to 0.60% MoM from 0.41% prior. Sectoral breakdown shows price pressures strongest in services (7.68%) - street food, restaurants, mobile phone services, car maintenance, medical consultations, tourism. Also elevated in healthcare/personal care (5.37%) and food/beverages/tobacco (4.43%). Citi Mexico survey consensus sees next 25bp cut in May with year-end 2026 rate at 6.50%. December Banxico meeting showed 4-1 vote split with dissenter Jonathan Heath arguing for hold to evaluate core/non-core trajectories.

**HF Take:** Headline beat masks dangerous core acceleration. The MoM jump from 0.41% to 0.60% is a 46% acceleration in monthly terms - this is the problem. Services at 7.68% is sticky and elevated, suggesting pricing power persists despite weak domestic demand (GDP growth consensus 0.4% for 2025). This persistence limits Banxico's easing scope materially. Market pricing May cut to 6.75% then cautious path to 6.50% by year-end, but if services don't moderate, May cut is at risk. The 4-1 vote split signals internal debate intensifying. MXN strength (+appreciation despite higher government bond yields) and weak activity provide some dovish cover, but core trajectory is the hawkish constraint that could force Banxico to pause longer than market expects.

---

#### **Mexico - PPI (Jan) - 13:00 CST**
**MoM:** +0.2% | Prior: +0.5%  
**YoY:** +1.5% | Prior: +2.1%

**Commentary:** Producer prices decelerating - MoM slowed to 0.2% from 0.5%, YoY eased to 1.5% from 2.1%.

**HF Take:** Limited pipeline inflation risks from producer side, but disconnect with accelerating consumer core (especially services) indicates consumption-side pricing power not captured by producer prices. This divergence reflects services vs goods split - PPI captures manufacturing/goods, but Mexico's inflation problem is in services (7.68%). PPI disinflation doesn't help Banxico if services remain sticky.

---

### **MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10**

#### **Japan - Money Supply (Feb 10, 00:50 JST)**
**M2:** ¥1,282.1T | Prior: ¥1,281.7T (rev)  
**Broad Money:** ¥2,244.9T | Prior: ¥2,244.7T (rev)

**Commentary:** Marginal uptick in money supply metrics consistent with BoJ's accommodative stance continuation.

**HF Take:** Growth remains modest (M2 +¥0.4T), reflecting limited credit demand despite negative rates. No major policy signal. BoJ maintaining ultra-loose policy as expected.

---

#### **Sweden - Industrial Production (Dec) - 08:00 CET**
**Private Production YoY:** +4.2% | Prior: +3.2% (rev)  
**Private Production MoM:** +1.6% | Prior: +0.2% (rev)  
**Industrial Production YoY:** +4.2% | Prior: +3.1% (rev)  
**Industrial Production MoM:** +5.1% | Prior: -0.3% (rev)

**Commentary:** Strong rebound in Swedish industrial activity with MoM surging +5.1% vs -0.3% revised prior. YoY acceleration to 4.2% from 3.1% revised.

**HF Take:** Robust manufacturing momentum despite eurozone weakness. Could reflect: (1) restocking after prior weakness, (2) export strength to non-EU markets, or (3) statistical base effects from weak comparison period. Supports Riksbank's view that Swedish economy remains resilient, potentially limiting easing scope beyond current expectations. Contrasts sharply with broader eurozone industrial malaise - if sustained, Sweden diverges from ECB path. However, +5.1% MoM is likely exaggerated by volatility; watch Q1 2026 for confirmation of trend vs bounce.

---

#### **Norway - CPI (Jan) - 08:00 CET** ⚠️ MAJOR SURPRISE
**Headline YoY:** +3.6% vs +3.1% poll | Prior: +3.2%  
**Headline MoM:** +0.6% | Prior: +0.1%  
**Core YoY:** +3.4% vs +3.0% poll | Prior: +3.1%  
**Core MoM:** +0.3% vs -0.1% poll | Prior: +0.1%

**Commentary:** Inflation accelerated to 3.6% YoY (highest in 4 months), well above 3.1% expected. MoM surge of 0.6% (vs 0.1% prior) marks largest monthly gain since late July. Core inflation jumped to 3.4% YoY with MoM at +0.3% against -0.1% consensus - a 40bp miss indicating broad-based pressure. Sectoral breakdown shows housing/utilities accelerated to 4.3% (vs 3.9%), transport spiked to 4.4% (vs 2.7%), restaurants/accommodation at 5.8% (vs 5.1%). Food moderated to 4.2% (vs 5.3%). SSB data shows labor market cooling with vacancies down 5.1% QoQ to 85,000 in Q4 2025. Norges Bank stated in January that "core inflation has been around 3% since autumn 2024, which is now a fairly long period" and maintained December forecast of 1-2 cuts in 2026. Post-data, Nomura revised to expect ONLY ONE cut in December 2026 (vs prior call for more), citing sticky wage growth.

**HF Take:** **MAJOR HAWKISH SHOCK.** This completely changes Norges Bank calculus. Headline +50bp miss (3.6% vs 3.1%), core +40bp miss (3.4% vs 3.0%), and critically the MoM core at +0.3% vs -0.1% expected is a 40bp surprise indicating this isn't statistical noise - it's broad-based acceleration. The combination of: (1) resilient mainland GDP (+0.4% QoQ), (2) accelerating inflation (3.6% highest in 4 months), (3) sticky core (3.4%), and (4) services inflation running 5.8% removes ALL easing urgency. Market had been pricing gradual cuts based on December guidance (1-2 in 2026); this forces immediate repricing. Nomura's revision to only one cut in Dec 2026 is the new baseline. Some analysts (Handelsbanken, DNB Carnegie, SEB) still calling for June cut to 3.75% followed by pause, but this data argues for Mar hold, Jun hold, and potential hike discussion if next prints don't moderate. NOK strengthening materially on this. **Critical for DM divergence trade** - if ECB cutting in March and Fed cutting later in 2026 while Norges Bank holds or hikes, NOK becomes carry trade destination. This is a regime shift for Norway monetary policy - from "gradual easing" to "wait and see" or potentially "one and done hold."

#### **Brazil - IPCA Inflation (Jan) - 13:00 BRT**
**MoM:** +0.33% vs +0.32% poll | Prior: +0.33%  
**YoY:** +4.44% vs +4.43% poll | Prior: +4.26%

**Commentary:** Inflation steady at 0.33% MoM (inline) but YoY ticked up to 4.44% from 4.26%, approaching upper tolerance band of 4.5%.

**HF Take:** BCB target is 3.0% +/- 1.5pp (range: 1.5%-4.5%). At 4.44%, Brazil is now just 6bp from the upper band. This is dangerous territory for BCB credibility. With policy rate at elevated levels and inflation trajectory toward upper bound, BCB must maintain restrictive stance. Any breach of 4.5% would force hawkish response or risk de-anchoring expectations. Limited easing scope; February data critical - if breaks 4.5%, BCB may need to reverse easing cycle entirely.

#### **United States - Import Prices (Dec) - 14:30 EST**
**YoY:** 0.0% | Prior: -0.1% (rev)  
**MoM:** +0.1% vs +0.1% poll | Prior: +0.4%

**Commentary:** Import prices flat at 0.0% YoY, MoM slowed to 0.1% from 0.4%.

**HF Take:** Flat year-over-year removes external inflation pressure from Fed's calculus. The MoM deceleration from +0.4% to +0.1% indicates commodity price stabilization and potentially weaker global demand transmission. Supports Fed's "last mile" disinflation narrative - one less hawkish concern ahead of Thursday CPI. No imported inflation means domestic sources (wages, services) are the only inflation risk, and ECI showed those moderating.

---

#### **United States - Retail Sales (Dec) - 14:30 EST** ⚠️ MAJOR MISS
**Headline MoM:** 0.0% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.6%  
**Ex-Autos MoM:** 0.0% vs +0.3% poll | Prior: +0.4% (rev)  
**Retail Control:** -0.1% vs +0.4% poll | Prior: +0.2% (rev)

**Commentary:** Significant deceleration in consumer spending entering 2026. Headline flat vs +0.4% expected and +0.6% prior; ex-autos flat vs +0.3% expected; critically, the control group (used for GDP) contracted -0.1% vs +0.4% expected - a 50bp miss and rare for this stable series. November revised down (ex-autos from +0.6% to +0.4%). Circana data shows combined five weeks ending Jan 3: revenue flat, unit demand -1%. By segment: food/beverage revenue +2% (units flat), non-edible CPG dollars +1% (units -3%), discretionary merchandise dollars -2% (units -5%). Full year 2025: 2% dollar growth, flat units. Consumer survey shows "bought on impulse" fell to <20% for most categories - lowest on record. Top purchase reason was self-gifting, not impulse. New product SKUs now 2% of discretionary sales vs 5% historical norm (same as pandemic lows). Price elevation curtailing purchases despite continued spending.

**HF Take:** This is structural, not cyclical. The control group contraction is critical - feeds directly into GDP consumption calculations, putting Q1 2026 estimates at risk. Atlanta Fed GDPNow will revise lower. But deeper issue: impulse buying collapsed to <20% of purchases (vs historical norms much higher) and new product penetration at pandemic emergency levels (2% vs 5%). This indicates exhausted consumers prioritizing necessities over discretionary. The fact this occurred during holiday shopping season ("busiest shopping periods") is the red flag - if consumers won't impulse-buy during holidays, when will they? Unit sales diverging from dollar sales (-1% units vs flat dollars) confirms price elevation driving the wedge. Consumers spending what they must but buying less. Combined with ECI wage moderation (+0.7% vs +0.8%), this points to weakening consumption into 2026. If Thursday CPI confirms disinflation, Fed has clear justification to cut - weak consumption + moderating wages + low imported inflation + disinflation = dovish cocktail. USD bearish, rates rally scenario building.

#### **United States - Employment Costs Index (Q4) - 14:30 EST**
**QoQ:** +0.7% vs +0.8% poll | Prior: +0.8%

**Commentary:** Civilian workers compensation rose 0.7% Q4, lowest since Q2 2021, below 0.8% expected. Private industry wages/salaries +3.4% YoY (lowest since Q1 2021), total compensation YoY +3.4% (down from 3.5% Q3). Union workers: wages +4.3% YoY / benefits +3.6%; non-union: wages +3.3% / benefits +3.4%. EY analysis notes wage growth has "converged toward 3.5% — below the ~4% pace historically associated with 2% inflation and 2% productivity growth" and executives focused on "controlling labor costs through wage restraint, operational efficiency and productivity gains." Cornell ILR notes union ECI peaked later (6.5% June 2024) than non-union (6% June 2022) due to multi-year contract structures.

**HF Take:** Fed's preferred wage gauge showing material moderation. The +0.7% QoQ runs ~2.8% annualized vs 3.2% in Q3 - this is the labor market slack transmitting to compensation that Powell needs to see. Wage-price spiral risk eliminated. At 3.4% YoY (below 4% "neutral" pace for 2% inflation + 2% productivity), this removes the last hawkish labor market concern. Combined with unemployment at 4.4% (stable), quits rate normalizing, and job openings declining, the full labor market normalization story is complete. Powell will cite this as evidence restrictive policy working without breaking the labor market - the "soft landing" narrative. Dovish lean materially reinforced. Thursday CPI is now the only remaining hurdle for Fed cuts.

#### **United States - Business Inventories (Nov) - 16:00 EST**
**MoM:** +0.1% vs +0.2% poll | Prior: +0.2% (rev)

**Commentary:** Modest inventory accumulation, slower than expected.

**HF Take:** Businesses remain cautious on inventory builds. Slower accumulation (+0.1% vs +0.2% expected) reduces GDP drag risk from future destocking, but overall neutral for growth outlook. Inventory cycle not a major swing factor currently - businesses managing lean in uncertain environment.

### **TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11** [UPCOMING]

#### **China - CPI/PPI (02:30 Beijing Time)** 🔴
- **Poll:** CPI +0.4% YoY (Prior: +0.8%), PPI -1.5% YoY (Prior: -1.9%)
- **Key Watch:** Deflation trajectory critical for global outlook. CPI deceleration from 0.8% to 0.4% would confirm persistent disinflationary pressures despite stimulus. PPI improvement (-1.5% vs -1.9%) suggests factory-gate stabilization but still in deflationary territory for 14+ consecutive months. Any deeper weakness (CPI <0.4% or PPI worse than -1.5%) could trigger global risk-off and intensify PBOC stimulus pressure.

#### **Italy - Industrial Output (10:00 CET)**
- **Poll:** -0.5% MoM (Prior: +1.5%)
- **Context:** Expected reversal from strong November. Watch for eurozone industrial weakness confirmation.

#### **Mexico - Industrial Output (13:00 CST)**
- **Poll:** +1.3% YoY (Prior: -0.8%)
- **Context:** Expected recovery from negative territory. Watch for nearshoring impact and whether matches soft domestic demand story.

#### **United States - Non-Farm Payrolls (14:30 EST)** 🔴
- **Poll:** 70k (Prior: 50k), Unemployment 4.4% (Prior: 4.4%), Avg Earnings YoY 3.6% (Prior: 3.8%)
- **Key Watch:** After ECI showed wage moderation to 3.4% YoY, payrolls test labor market resilience. 70k expected vs 50k prior is modest acceleration - watch for revisions to prior months and sectoral composition. If payrolls miss (<50k) AND earnings decelerate further (<3.6%), dovish Fed pricing intensifies materially. Conversely, strong beat (>100k) with wage reacceleration questions "soft landing" narrative. Goldilocks scenario: 60-80k with wages at 3.5-3.6%.

#### **Canada - Building Permits (13:00 EST)**
- **Poll:** 5.0% MoM (Prior: -13.1%)
- **Context:** Expected bounce after sharp prior drop.

---

### **WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12** [UPCOMING]

#### **Japan - Corp Goods Prices (00:50 JST)**
- **Poll:** +0.2% MoM, +2.3% YoY (Prior: +0.1%, +2.4%)
- **Context:** Producer price trajectory - watch for whether still transmitting to consumer prices or moderating.

#### **South Africa - Mining Production (10:30 SAST)**
- **Prior:** -2.7% YoY
- **Context:** EM commodity demand indicator.

#### **South Africa - Manufacturing Production (12:00 SAST)**
- **Prior:** -1.1% MoM
- **Context:** Broader EM production trends.

#### **Brazil - Service Sector Growth (13:00 BRT)**
- **Prior:** -0.1% MoM
- **Context:** Watch for services recovery after prior contraction.

#### **United States - Initial Jobless Claims (14:30 EST)**
- **Poll:** 222k (Prior: 231k)
- **Key Watch:** Expected decline suggests labor market stability. Watch for any spike >250k which would signal deterioration. Claims have been remarkably stable in 200-240k range - any break above signals concern.

#### **United States - Existing Home Sales (16:00 EST)**
- **Poll:** 4.35M (Prior: 4.18M)
- **Key Watch:** Expected +4% MoM improvement from very depressed levels. Watch for whether mortgage rates stabilization (7%+ range) allowing some activity or if higher-for-longer rates continuing to dampen demand. Housing market critical GDP component.

#### **New Zealand - Manufacturing PMI (22:30 NZDT)**
- **Prior:** 56.1
- **Context:** Check on NZ manufacturing momentum.

---

### **THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13** [UPCOMING] - MAJOR EVENT DAY

#### **Switzerland - CPI (08:30 CET)**
- **Poll:** 0.0% MoM, 0.1% YoY (Prior: 0.0%, 0.1%)
- **Context:** Swiss inflation remains subdued.

#### **Spain - CPI Final (09:00 CET)**
- **Poll:** Confirmation of flash estimates (-0.4% MoM, +2.4% YoY headline; -0.7% MoM, +2.5% YoY HICP)
- **Context:** Final data rarely deviates from flash.

#### **Eurozone - GDP Flash (11:00 CET)** 🔴
- **Poll:** +0.3% QoQ, +1.3% YoY
- **Key Watch:** Q4 growth confirmation critical after Monday's Sentix improvement (+4.2 from -1.8). If GDP beats (>0.3%), validates sentiment turn and supports EUR; if misses (<0.3%), questions resilience narrative and suggests Sentix was false hope. Employment data also released (+0.2% QoQ expected). ECB watching closely as this informs March meeting decision.

#### **Eurozone - Trade Balance (11:00 CET)**
- **Context:** Watch for export strength/weakness signals amid global slowdown concerns.

#### **Brazil - Retail Sales (13:00 BRT)**
- **Poll:** +2.50% YoY (Prior: +1.30%)
- **Context:** Watch for consumption recovery signals after prior weakness.

#### **United States - CPI (14:30 EST)** 🔴🔴 WEEK'S MAIN EVENT
- **Poll:** Core +0.3% MoM / +2.5% YoY; Headline +0.3% MoM / +2.5% YoY
- **CRITICAL WATCH:** After weak retail sales (0.0% vs 0.4%), moderating ECI (+0.7% vs +0.8%), and flat import prices (0.0% YoY), this is make-or-break for disinflation narrative. Market pricing for Fed March meeting depends entirely on this print.
  
  **Scenarios:**
  - **Core MoM <0.2% (Dovish explosion):** Confirms disinflation accelerating. Rate cut pricing for March jumps materially. USD collapses, yields plunge, equities rally. Powell vindicated on "patient" approach. Market prices 75%+ probability of March cut.
  
  - **Core MoM 0.3% (In-line):** Supports current narrative. Disinflation continuing but not accelerating. Fed remains data-dependent. March cut pricing stays 40-50% range. USD/yields sideways.
  
  - **Core MoM >0.3% (Hawkish shock):** Disinflation stalling or reversing. Forces Fed recalibration. Rate cut pricing pushed to May or beyond. USD rallies, yields spike, equities sell off. Questions soft landing narrative entirely.
  
  **Key components to watch:** Shelter (largest core weight, has been sticky), core services ex-shelter (Fed's focus), used cars (volatile but important).

## CROSS-ASSET THEMES & POSITIONING

### **Theme 1: US Disinflation + Consumption Weakness = Dovish Fed**
**Evidence:** Retail sales 0.0% (control -0.1%), ECI +0.7% (lowest since Q2 2021), import prices 0.0% YoY  
**Catalyst:** Thursday CPI - if confirms disinflation (<0.3% core MoM), Fed has clear path to cut  
**Positioning:** Short USD (particularly vs EUR, GBP), long front-end rates, overweight US equities on earnings resilience vs rates relief

### **Theme 2: Norway Divergence - DM's Hawkish Outlier**
**Evidence:** CPI 3.6% (vs 3.1% poll), core 3.4% (vs 3.0% poll), services 5.8%  
**Catalyst:** Nomura revised to only ONE cut in Dec 2026; other analysts still calling June but data argues for longer hold  
**Positioning:** Long NOK vs EUR (divergence trade - ECB cutting, Norges holding/hiking), long Norway rates, potential carry trade destination if rates stay 4%+ while DM cuts

### **Theme 3: China Deflation Persistence**
**Evidence:** CPI expected to decelerate to 0.4% from 0.8%; PPI negative for 14+ months  
**Catalyst:** Tuesday CPI print - worse than expected triggers global risk-off  
**Positioning:** Defensive stance on China exposure, watch for PBOC stimulus response, EM Asia vulnerable to China spillover

### **Theme 4: EM Inflation Divergence - Mexico vs Brazil**
**Evidence:** Mexico core accelerating (0.60% MoM) despite weak demand; Brazil at 4.44% (near 4.5% upper band)  
**Catalyst:** Both central banks facing constraints on easing despite weak growth  
**Positioning:** MXN supported by rate differentials but vulnerable if Banxico forced to pause; BRL at risk if inflation breaches 4.5% band

### **Theme 5: Eurozone Tentative Recovery**
**Evidence:** Sentix jumped to +4.2 (from -1.8), but hard data needed for confirmation  
**Catalyst:** Thursday GDP flash - beats validate optimism, miss reveals false hope  
**Positioning:** Cautiously constructive EUR but needs data validation; fade on GDP miss

---

## UPDATED WEEK OUTLOOK

**What Changed Since Week Start:**
- Norway inflation shock forces monetary policy repricing (only 1 cut now expected vs 1-2 prior)
- US consumption weakness deeper than expected (control group negative, impulse buying collapsed)
- Mexico core inflation persistence despite weak economy limits Banxico flexibility

**Key Events Remaining:**
- **Tuesday:** China CPI (deflation check), US NFP (labor market resilience)
- **Thursday:** EUR GDP (recovery validation), US CPI (THE event for Fed pricing)

**Central Scenario:**
- China CPI confirms deflation persists (0.4% or lower) → stimulus pressure builds
- US NFP modest (60-80k), wages moderate (3.5-3.6%) → soft landing narrative intact
- US CPI inline to soft (0.2-0.3% core MoM) → dovish Fed lean continues, March cut 40-50% priced
- EUR GDP confirms modest growth (0.3%) → tentative recovery story holds

**Tail Risks:**
- **Upside:** US CPI <0.2% core MoM (dovish explosion), China stimulus announcement, EUR GDP >0.4%
- **Downside:** US CPI >0.4% core MoM (hawkish shock), China CPI <0.2% (deflation deepening), Norway forces more DM hawks

**Positioning for Remainder of Week:**
- Hold powder dry for Thursday CPI - biggest vol event
- Fade China rallies on deflation print unless accompanied by stimulus
- Long NOK on dips vs EUR (divergence trade)
- Defensive on US consumption proxies (retail, consumer discretionary)
