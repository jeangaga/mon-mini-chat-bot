EXECUTION_OVERLAY_MASTER_FINAL_v2 (AUDIT-LOCKED)
Date: 2025-12-24 (Paris)

====================================================
GLOBAL HARD GATES — NO OUTPUT UNLESS VALID
====================================================

G1) FIXED SCHEMA REQUIRED
High-quality analysis that does not strictly follow
the MA.txt section schema is INVALID.
Auditability takes precedence over intelligence.

G2) DATE-CONSTRAINT CHECK
Date coherence is NOT sufficient.
The agent MUST explicitly state that the date-constraint
has been checked and passed.

G3) OFFICIAL RELEASE COMPLETENESS
Missing any major official macro release (GDP, CPI, NFP,
central bank decision) = AUTOMATIC INVALID.

G4) CENTRAL BANK SPEAKER TAPE
If market-relevant communications exist in rolling 1M,
named speakers + dates + message are mandatory.



====================================================
USER DATA & CONTEXT RECONCILIATION (MANDATORY – HARD GATE)
====================================================

G-UD1) USER-PROVIDED DATA PRIORITY & INTEGRATION

If the execution chat contains macro data pasted by the user
(figures, summaries, commentary):

- The agent MUST treat this data as an explicit input source.
- ALL user-provided macro data MUST be included and commented.
- User-provided data MUST NOT be silently dropped, overwritten,
  or re-attributed.

If user-provided data fall outside the strict date window:
- They MUST be included as Context / Regime Anchors.

Failure to integrate ALL user-provided macro data
→ AUTOMATIC INVALID OUTPUT.


G-UD2) UNION-MODE DATA RECONCILIATION

The effective dataset for the run is defined as:

USER DATA ∪ INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED PROFESSIONAL DATA

Rules:
- Missing data or missing weeks in user notes MUST be reconstructed
  from professional sources.
- If both user data and external data exist, TAKE THE UNION,
  not the intersection.
- Absence of user data MUST NOT be interpreted as absence of release.


G-UD3) DISCREPANCY HANDLING

If user-provided data conflict with independently sourced data:
- The agent MUST flag the discrepancy explicitly.
- Both versions MUST remain visible unless instructed otherwise.
- The agent MUST NOT silently correct user-provided data.

If no discrepancy exists:
- Verification MUST remain implicit (no mention in output).


G-UD4) CONTEXT CONTINUITY ACROSS RUNS

If a previous MA.txt run exists in the execution chat:
- The agent MUST reuse it as contextual memory
  (macro regime, anchors, framing).
- New data update or refine the regime; they MUST NOT
  mechanically reset it.


G-UD5) OUTPUT HYGIENE

- NO web links, URLs, citations, or source references
  are allowed in the output text.
- Source checking is implicit and MUST NOT be documented.

Violation of any rule above
→ AUTOMATIC INVALID OUTPUT.



G-OH1) EXECUTION METADATA EXCLUSION

Within the output block enclosed by:

<<<REGION_MACRO_NOTE_BEGIN>>>
...
<<<REGION_MACRO_NOTE_END>>>

the agent MUST NOT include:

- execution checks or diagnostics
  (e.g. date-constraint checks, PASS/FAIL statements),
- internal gate titles or headings,
- overlay or MA.txt rule references,
- validation statements or self-auditing language.

The output MUST contain ONLY
the macro content defined by MA.txt section titles.

Violation → AUTOMATIC INVALID OUTPUT.



G-2) OUTPUT FORMATTING — SECTION HEADER STYLE (HARD RULE)


All macro note section headers MUST use the following
lightweight, uniform format:

<Section Title>
-------------------------------------------------

Example (MANDATORY STYLE):

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information
-------------------------------------------------

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)
--------------------------------------------

Top-Down Macro
--------------

Central Bank Speaker Tape
-------------------------

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact
--------------------------------------------

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution
--------------------------------------------

PROHIBITED:
- Heavy visual separators (e.g. "=====", "#####", boxed titles)
- Oversized banners around section titles
- PDF / sell-side style framing

RATIONALE:
- Preserve analytical density
- Avoid visual dominance of any single section
- Maintain hedge-fund / PM notebook aesthetics

Violation of this formatting rule
→ AUTOMATIC INVALID OUTPUT.

====================================================
QUALITY THRESHOLD — BENCHMARK-LOCKED (HARD GATE)
====================================================

PM Self-Assessment is a HARD STOP condition.
Absence, misplacement, or vagueness blocks the output
regardless of apparent quality.

The self-assessment MUST explicitly score the run
against the latest validated benchmark
(e.g. USMacroLatest.txt), not against internal standards.

The score MUST reflect the following FIVE dimensions:

1) Signal hierarchy
   - One dominant binding constraint clearly identified
   - Secondary signals and noise explicitly pruned

2) Causal & analytical compression
   - Clear chain: data → dominant macro loop → reaction function
   - No parallel, evenly-weighted, or narrative-heavy analysis

3) Reaction-function precision
   - Central bank communication shifts probabilities
   - Asymmetries (hawkish vs dovish tails) explicitly stated

4) Professional / hedge-fund narrative depth (MANDATORY)
   - Explicit evidence of consultation of HF-followed
     and institutional macro sources beyond Bloomberg/Reuters
   - Integration of non-obvious professional insights
     (revisions, composition effects, caveats, what professionals ignored)
   - Clear articulation of:
       • prevailing professional base case,
       • key debates,
       • tail risks,
       • and what would force a narrative shift

5) PM-level decision usefulness
   - Analysis materially reduces the risk of a macro-driven mistake
   - Makes unambiguous what matters most, what does not, and why

Scoring rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Any material weakness vs the benchmark
  in ANY dimension caps the score at ≤ 9.6 / 10.
- Superficial or absent treatment of
  Dimension (4) AUTOMATICALLY caps the score at ≤ 9.4 / 10.
- A score < 9.8 / 10 is AUTOMATICALLY INVALID
  and triggers a mandatory full re-run.

Only runs demonstrably comparable to or exceeding
the benchmark in sharpness, hierarchy,
professional depth, and PM judgement
may score ≥ 9.8 / 10.
