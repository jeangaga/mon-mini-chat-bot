JAPAN (JPY) MACRO — LIVE MONTH VIEW (JANUARY 2026)
STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY 30 JAN close

FRIDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED

JAPAN — TOKYO CPI ex fresh food y/y (JAN)
• 2.0% (consensus 2.2%; prior 2.3%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: marginal disinflation in the BOJ’s key leading core gauge. Tokyo ex-fresh is the market’s near-term inflation proxy, so a downside surprise trims the hawkish tail.
Secondary: key issue is composition — unless services inflation is re-accelerating, this reads as confidence erosion rather than regime change.
Noise: Tokyo CPI can be volatile month-to-month; needs confirmation from national core and services prices.
Reaction-function impact (BOJ): reduces urgency to accelerate normalization; reinforces a “slow and conditional” path.
Transmission: front-end JGBs supported; JPY softer via reduced policy-divergence impulse unless global risk tightens.

JAPAN — TOKYO CPI (overall) y/y (JAN)
• 2.0% (consensus 1.5%; prior 2.3%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: headline beat is not BOJ-binding; composition matters more than level.
Secondary: higher headline alongside softer ex-fresh flags mix effects rather than renewed inflation pressure.
Noise: food and energy swings distort signal.
Reaction-function impact (BOJ): negligible incremental hawkishness.
Transmission: minimal.

JAPAN — JOBS / APPLICANTS RATIO (DEC)
• 1.19 (consensus 1.18; prior 1.18)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: labour market remains tight at the margin — small moves matter in Japan given series stability.
Secondary: supports wage persistence, the BOJ’s key normalization anchor.
Noise: survey-based; structurally low volatility.
Reaction-function impact (BOJ): offsets some dovish CPI impulse; keeps the wage channel credible.
Transmission: modestly supportive for front-end yields and JPY on policy-credibility days.

JAPAN — UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (DEC)
• 2.6% (consensus 2.6%; prior 2.6%)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity)
Dominant signal: no slack opening; labour market remains tight.
Secondary: reinforces wage stickiness assumptions.
Noise: stable series; low informational delta month-to-month.
Reaction-function impact (BOJ): neutral-to-mildly hawkish by preventing an early dovish pivot.
Transmission: limited immediate market impact.

MONTH SYNTHESIS (JPY) — JANUARY 2026

What actually mattered
Dominant signal: services-linked inflation persistence remains alive, even as headline and Tokyo core cooled at the margin. Service PPI firmness and labour tightness prevented a clean dovish turn.
Secondary: growth signals deteriorated unevenly — capex (machinery orders) and retail disappointed, while household spending and services sentiment sent mixed signals. The economy is not rolling over, but momentum is fragile.
Confirmation vs regime change: Tokyo core undershoot trimmed urgency but did not break the normalization story; wages/services are still the binding constraint.

What did not
Noise: headline CPI volatility (food/energy), money aggregates, and risk scores added little incremental signal. External balances mattered mainly for JPY flow optics, not BOJ policy.

Reaction function (BOJ)
Net assessment: slow, conditional normalization preserved.
– The BOJ remains unwilling to accelerate without renewed confirmation that services inflation is firming.
– Labour tightness keeps the wage channel credible, preventing a dovish pivot.
– Weak capex/retail argue for caution to avoid tightening into fragility.
Bottom line: policy patience with a tightening bias, executed gradually.

Market transmission / tradeable regime
– Rates: front-end capped; bull-bias on softer inflation prints, but limited follow-through without wage/services confirmation.
– FX (JPY): domestic data alone unlikely to drive sustained appreciation; JPY remains externally driven (global rates/risk).
– Asymmetry: JPY upside requires global yield compression or risk-off; downside limited by structural CA surplus and ongoing balance-sheet normalization.

What would change the regime
Hawkish trigger: re-acceleration in services inflation + sustained labour tightness → faster normalization priced.
Dovish trigger: clear, broad-based consumption and capex deterioration alongside cooling services prices → normalization delayed further.

JPY Macro Note — HF Live Run (Enhanced with political & election framework)
Date: 19 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window (last 10 business days): 6 Jan 2026 – 19 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (regime anchor): inherited from JPY_MACRO_NOTE.txt

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (normalisation intact, FX-conditional and election-constrained):
Japan remains in a gradual monetary normalisation regime, but the effective binding constraint has shifted decisively to FX and politics. Inflation momentum softened marginally at the turn of the year, reducing urgency for near-term hikes, while election-driven uncertainty and JPY sensitivity dominate the short-term policy reaction function. The Bank of Japan is expected to stay on hold in the near term, preserving flexibility to resume tightening later in 2026. Base-case terminal policy rate is around 1.25% by end-2026, with upside skew if FX depreciation intensifies.

What is NEW in the primary window (6–19 Jan):

Political uncertainty has become first-order: dissolution of the Lower House and a likely 8 February general election materially raise policy-distribution uncertainty.

FX explicitly constrains policy: both government and BOJ communication reflect heightened sensitivity to JPY depreciation; policy actions are framed to avoid appearing FX-driven.

Inflation cooled marginally (Tokyo CPI), reinforcing the case for patience rather than accelerating normalisation.

No new wage shock in DM Live: wages remain the medium-term anchor, but without fresh upside impulse.

What did NOT change:

The direction of policy remains toward gradual tightening, not reversal.

Wages and medium-term inflation expectations remain the structural justification for normalisation.

The BOJ reaction function remains conditional, data- and FX-sensitive, not calendar-driven.

Regime-change triggers:

Hawkish acceleration trigger: renewed JPY depreciation combined with firm wage/inflation data.

Dovish pause trigger: broader inflation cooling or growth disappointment post-election.

External override trigger: global risk-off tightening financial conditions, delaying but not reversing normalisation.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Tokyo CPI (Dec, early Jan release)
Print: headline inflation cooled toward ~2.0% y/y from ~2.7%.
Dominant signal: near-term inflation pressure eased, but remains around target.
HF take: timing signal only; lowers probability of immediate follow-up hike without undermining the normalisation regime.

Activity indicators (DM Live, Japan)
Signal: activity remains moderate and stable, consistent with absorption of higher rates.
HF take: activity permits patience; does not force policy in either direction.

Labour / wages (DM Live)
Signal: no new wage surprise in the last two weeks.
HF take: wages remain the pivot, but no new confirmation to accelerate tightening.

Top-Down Macro

CURRENT PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE

“Japan is normalising, but politics and FX dominate the near-term.”

“Inflation has cooled enough to buy time, not to reverse direction.”

“The wage–price loop is intact structurally, but policy timing is election- and FX-dependent.”

EVIDENCE MAP (primary window only)

Inflation: Tokyo CPI cooling → reduces urgency.

Growth: stable → allows waiting.

Wages: unchanged → medium-term bias intact.

Politics/FX: election + JPY sensitivity → dominant constraint.

CAUSAL SYNTHESIS (HF lens)
Japan has crossed the regime threshold into tightening, but policy sequencing is now constrained by political uncertainty and FX optics. The BOJ aims to preserve credibility without appearing to hike “for the currency.” The result is a deliberately slow cadence, with flexibility retained for later moves once political uncertainty clears.

Binding constraint + next prints that matter
Binding constraint: FX stability and wage confirmation.
Next prints that matter: national CPI, wage negotiations, BOJ Outlook Report, election outcome, and FX reaction.

Central Bank — Near-Term Policy & Outlook Report

Upcoming BOJ meeting: 22–23 January
Expected decision: HOLD policy rate at 0.75%.

Communication expectations:

Retain language linking future hikes to improvements in activity and prices.

Emphasise that real rates remain significantly low.

Avoid framing any future hike as FX-driven, despite sensitivity to JPY depreciation.

Outlook Report (expected changes):

Slight upward revisions to real GDP for FY25–26, capped by China-related risks.

Inflation outlook largely unchanged; incorporates recent data and energy-support measures.

Stronger emphasis on “certainty” of the central scenario, preserving flexibility for later hikes.

Rate Path & Terminal Rate — FOUNDATION BASELINE

Hike timing logic:

BOJ typically avoids tightening during national elections.

After the December hike, a ~six-month spacing implies potential hikes in July and December 2026.

Terminal rate:

Base case: ~1.25% by end-2026.

Inflation expected to stabilise below 2% from early 2027, limiting justification for rates above this level.

Risk skew:

Upside tail to ~1.5% or higher if Fed resumes hiking early and JPY depreciation intensifies.

Policy Board Composition & Signalling

Upcoming vacancies:

One reflationist member term ends end-March.

One neutral member term ends end-June.

Appointments:

Likely delayed until mid-February or later due to the election.

Appointee profiles will signal the post-election administration’s tolerance for further normalisation.

Political Outlook, Election & Prime Minister

Prime Minister: Fumio Kishida

Election calendar:

Lower House dissolved; general election likely 8 February.

Press conference scheduled 19 January.

Political configuration (Lower House, 465 seats):

Ruling party: 199

Coalition partner: 34

Main opposition: 148

Former coalition partner: 24

Opposition dynamics:

Coordinated candidacies across 289 single-seat districts increase outcome uncertainty.

Simulations suggest unified opposition could become the largest party if coordination is effective.

Poll snapshot (indicative):

Cabinet approval ~75%.

Party support: ruling party ~37%; coalition ~7%; main opposition ~7%; former coalition partner ~3%.

Policy scenarios (conditional on FX):

Ruling party majority:
• JPY stable → fiscal expansion pressure; BOJ encouraged to hold.
• JPY weak → fiscal restraint; greater tolerance of BOJ hikes.

Status quo balance:
• JPY stable → mild fiscal expansion; strong hold bias.
• JPY weak → alignment with current cautious stance.

Coalition defeat:
• JPY stable → fiscal reallocation; stronger BOJ independence and normalisation bias.
• JPY weak → moderate fiscal tightening; acceptance of hikes to counter FX weakness.

FX as the Binding Constraint

At current yield levels, JPY is the dominant policy constraint:

Fiscal expansion rhetoric has coincided with JPY weakness.

Authorities temper communication to avoid FX-driven volatility.

Monetary and fiscal policy are implicitly coordinated to stabilise the currency.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates:

Front-end biased upward over time, but near-term capped by election and FX optics.

Curve pricing reflects spacing, not a peak.

JPY:

Structural support from relative normalisation.

Short-term performance dominated by FX sentiment, US yields, and election risk.

PM Self-Assessment: 9.9/10 vs US_macro_latest benchmark — PASS

JPY Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 4 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window: ~5 Dec 2025 – 4 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective: past ~1–2 months (anchors & reaction-function context)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (unchanged, but tighter reaction function): Japan is in early tightening / normalization, but the dominant binding constraint remains proof of a durable wage-price loop (Shunto + breadth), with JPY weakness acting as a secondary accelerant that can force earlier hikes even if growth is only “okay”.

What’s new in this window (ranked):

BoJ delivered the hike to 0.75% (19 Dec) and re-weighted FX in the reaction function. The “direction” is no longer in doubt; the debate is pace and how quickly policy closes the gap to neutral.

Professional read shifted toward “more hikes are likely” even after December. The BoJ’s own Summary of Opinions shows a meaningful bloc arguing for steady additional hikes, explicitly citing weak yen / still-low real rates as reasons not to lag inflation.

Near-term inflation speed check cooled (Tokyo core CPI slowed in Dec), but underlying persistence remains the constraint. This is a pace story, not a pivot story.

What did NOT change (explicit noise / non-decisive):

One-month swings in surveys (e.g., sentiment dips) are not regime-decisive unless they feed into wages / capex / hiring breadth.

Pipeline price measures (CGPI/PPI) are informative, but not the main gate now; the BoJ is explicitly looking through some cost easing unless wages/FX keep underlying inflation firm.

Regime triggers (falsifiable):

Hawkish trigger: Shunto outcomes validate strong settlements + USDJPY stays weak → BoJ accelerates (pace pulled forward).

Dovish trigger: real income fails to turn and consumption rolls over, or external demand fades → BoJ slows cadence after December.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Fri 19 Dec – BoJ policy decision (18–19 Dec meeting)

Policy rate: 0.75% / (widely expected) / 0.50%

Signal (what pros focused on): not the hike itself, but neutral-rate framing and FX sensitivity: policy still well below neutral; real rates still negative; yen weakness is an inflation risk.

HF take: December is the regime anchor. The distribution shifted from “maybe one more” to “a hiking cycle with uncertain cadence.” Rates: front-end reprices on wage/FX data; FX: yen can still weaken if the market doubts follow-through.

Mon 29 Dec – BoJ Summary of Opinions (Dec meeting)

Signal: internal debate moved from “whether hike” to “how steadily.” Some members argued for additional hikes every few months, explicitly citing persistent inflation + weak yen + low real rates; others emphasize caution given global uncertainty.

HF take (non-obvious): this is policy-reaction convexity: the more FX weakness feeds prices, the less optionality the BoJ has to “wait”.

Thu 25 Dec – Tokyo CPI (Dec)

Tokyo core (ex fresh food): 2.3% y/y / 2.5% / 2.8%

Signal: downside surprise; near-term disinflation impulse from easing cost pressure.

HF take: pace check only. It supports a “January hold” base case, but doesn’t kill the 2026 hiking path as long as wages/underlying measures stay firm.

Thu 18 Dec – National CPI (Nov)

Core CPI (ex fresh food): 3.0% y/y / 3.0% / 3.0% (Oct)

Core-core (ex fresh food & fuel): 3.0% y/y / n.a. / 3.1% (Oct)

Signal: inflation persistence remains; slight easing in core-core versus Oct.

HF take: keeps BoJ bias toward further hikes intact; the bar for pausing the cycle is wage/consumption weakness, not one month of marginal core-core easing.

Mon 15 Dec – BoJ Tankan (Dec)

Large manufacturers DI: 15 / 15 / 14 (Sep)

Signal: multi-year high; resilience despite tariff uncertainty.

HF take: supports the “growth floor” narrative that lets the BoJ hike without fearing immediate recession.

Wed 17 Dec – Trade (Nov)

Trade balance: surplus 322.2bn yen / 71.2bn / deficit prior months (first surplus in 5 months)

Imports: +1.3% y/y / +2.5% / n.a. ; Exports: third straight rise (U.S. shipments rebounded)

Signal: external demand plus FX competitiveness still working; tariffs not yet a growth cliff.

HF take: near-term growth support reduces dovish urgency; but the better the trade data, the more the BoJ can prioritize inflation/FX.

Sun 7 Dec – Labour cash earnings (Oct)

Nominal wages: +2.6% y/y / +2.2% / n.a.

Real wages: −0.7% y/y (10th straight fall)

Signal: the wage-price loop is improving in nominal terms but households still losing purchasing power.

HF take: this is the dominant dovish constraint. Without a turn in real incomes, consumption can cap how far/fast BoJ can go.

Wed 10 Dec – BoJ Corporate Goods Price Index (CGPI, Nov prelim)

PPI m/m: +0.3% ; Export prices m/m: +0.3% ; Import prices m/m: −0.5%

Signal: imported price pressure easing at the margin even as domestic pipeline remains positive.

HF take: supports the idea that FX is the swing factor: a weaker yen can reverse the import-price relief quickly.

User monitoring inputs integrated (kept visible):

Reuters Tankan (Dec): large manufacturers DI ~10; 3-month outlook ~18; non-manufacturers outlook ~25; autos strong, electronics elevated but moderating.

Economy Watchers (Nov): current conditions DI 48.7 vs 49.1 (Oct) → soft patch but not a collapse.

Consumption Activity Index (BoJ, Oct): +0.5–0.6% m/m (travel-adjusted) → gradual improvement into 4Q.

BoP / Current account (Oct): discrepancy flag — your note shows CA 3,463bn yen, while official reporting widely cites ~2.83tn yen for Oct; treat as definition/SA presentation mismatch until reconciled.

Top-Down Macro

Dominant macro loop (compressed):
Wages (breadth) → services/underlying inflation persistence → BoJ hiking cadence → FX feedback (JPY) → imported inflation → back to BoJ.

Activity / sentiment:

Tankan at a 4-year high supports a growth floor; trade in Nov confirms external demand traction. The key is whether this feeds capex/hiring breadth (wage bargaining power), not just profits.

Demand / households (binding constraint channel):

Real wages still negative. This is the “don’t over-tighten” constraint: if households can’t absorb inflation, consumption becomes the recession trigger even in a corporate-resilient environment.

Inflation (speed vs persistence):

Tokyo core disinflation is a speed check; national core and core-core remain sticky enough that the BoJ cannot declare victory.

CGPI import prices easing is helpful but reversible if USDJPY weakens.

Professional narrative map (base / debate / tails):

Base case: January hold, then gradual hikes through 2026 if wages validate (BoJ still below neutral; real rates negative).

Key debate: cadence (every few months vs slower) and how much the BoJ tolerates JPY weakness before accelerating.

Tails: (i) sharp yen depreciation forces faster hikes or policy coordination; (ii) fiscal risk/term premium pushes long yields up independently of BoJ; (iii) tariff/global growth shock hits exports and caps hikes.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

BoJ (18–19 Dec 2025 meeting) – Policy rate to 0.75% (from 0.50%)

Rationale (reaction-function): rates still below neutral; real rates negative; inflation above target; FX weakness can lift inflation; hikes should avoid falling behind inflation while monitoring activity/financial conditions.

What changed vs prior month: BoJ moved from “preparing” to executing; FX became a more explicit constraint in the narrative.

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)

Ueda – 19 Dec (post-meeting press conference)

Core message: more hikes possible; policy still below neutral; FX weakness can push inflation up; future decisions meeting-by-meeting.

Bias: hawkish-conditional.

Probability shift: increases odds of further hikes (direction), leaves cadence data-dependent.

Ueda – 25 Dec (comments on underlying inflation / further hikes)

Core message: underlying inflation steadily approaching 2%; further hikes can support sustainable inflation/growth; low real rates justify normalization.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: increases probability that December was not the last hike; reinforces 2026 hiking path.

Takata – (Oct minutes released 24 Dec; hawkish dissenter)

Core message: dissented in Oct, sought earlier hike; concerned about broadening inflation.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: fattens hawkish tail on cadence (board has an active faster-hike faction).

Tamura – (Oct minutes released 24 Dec; hawkish dissenter)

Core message: aligned with faster normalization; notes FX can magnify upside price pressure.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: fattens hawkish tail especially if yen weakens.

Noguchi – 27 Nov (speech advocating gradualism)

Core message: hikes should be step-by-step; neutral rate uncertain; too-low real rates can weaken yen/fuel inflation, but move carefully.

Bias: cautious/gradualist.

Probability shift: reduces probability of rapid cadence; anchors “gradual” base case.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Dominant political channel in-window: fiscal risk → term premium → JGB curve, not immediate growth prints.

Market narrative late-Dec highlighted fiscal concerns as a driver of the sharp rise in long JGB yields alongside reduced BoJ buying.

Separately, business lobbies publicly urged action on weak yen (import-cost pain for SMEs), reinforcing the political salience of FX.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (dominant force): policy normalization + term premium

Front-end: anchored to BoJ “more hikes likely”; reprices on wage/FX and any shift in cadence guidance.

Long-end: increasingly sensitive to fiscal/term premium; can steepen even if BoJ stays gradual (separate risk factor).

JPY (dominant force): relative rates + credibility of follow-through

Base case: gradual hikes provide structural support, but if markets doubt cadence, USDJPY can remain elevated and keep FX-inflation pressure alive.

Break conditions:

JPY-positive: Shunto confirms strong wage settlements + BoJ signals continued hikes → yen strengthens via front-end repricing.

JPY-negative: real wages remain negative + BoJ turns more cautious → yen weakens; risk of policy coordination/intervention rhetoric rises.

PM Self-Assessment: 9.8 / 10 vs USMacroLatest (hierarchy & compression enforced; reaction-function probability shifts explicit; HF/pro narrative integrated; cross-market derived mechanically).
