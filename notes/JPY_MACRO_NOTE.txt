JPY Macro Note – HF Live Run
Date: 4 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Primary window: ~5 Dec 2025 – 4 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective: past ~1–2 months (anchors & reaction-function context)

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

Macro regime (unchanged, but tighter reaction function): Japan is in early tightening / normalization, but the dominant binding constraint remains proof of a durable wage-price loop (Shunto + breadth), with JPY weakness acting as a secondary accelerant that can force earlier hikes even if growth is only “okay”.

What’s new in this window (ranked):

BoJ delivered the hike to 0.75% (19 Dec) and re-weighted FX in the reaction function. The “direction” is no longer in doubt; the debate is pace and how quickly policy closes the gap to neutral.

Professional read shifted toward “more hikes are likely” even after December. The BoJ’s own Summary of Opinions shows a meaningful bloc arguing for steady additional hikes, explicitly citing weak yen / still-low real rates as reasons not to lag inflation.

Near-term inflation speed check cooled (Tokyo core CPI slowed in Dec), but underlying persistence remains the constraint. This is a pace story, not a pivot story.

What did NOT change (explicit noise / non-decisive):

One-month swings in surveys (e.g., sentiment dips) are not regime-decisive unless they feed into wages / capex / hiring breadth.

Pipeline price measures (CGPI/PPI) are informative, but not the main gate now; the BoJ is explicitly looking through some cost easing unless wages/FX keep underlying inflation firm.

Regime triggers (falsifiable):

Hawkish trigger: Shunto outcomes validate strong settlements + USDJPY stays weak → BoJ accelerates (pace pulled forward).

Dovish trigger: real income fails to turn and consumption rolls over, or external demand fades → BoJ slows cadence after December.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (HF take)

Fri 19 Dec – BoJ policy decision (18–19 Dec meeting)

Policy rate: 0.75% / (widely expected) / 0.50%

Signal (what pros focused on): not the hike itself, but neutral-rate framing and FX sensitivity: policy still well below neutral; real rates still negative; yen weakness is an inflation risk.

HF take: December is the regime anchor. The distribution shifted from “maybe one more” to “a hiking cycle with uncertain cadence.” Rates: front-end reprices on wage/FX data; FX: yen can still weaken if the market doubts follow-through.

Mon 29 Dec – BoJ Summary of Opinions (Dec meeting)

Signal: internal debate moved from “whether hike” to “how steadily.” Some members argued for additional hikes every few months, explicitly citing persistent inflation + weak yen + low real rates; others emphasize caution given global uncertainty.

HF take (non-obvious): this is policy-reaction convexity: the more FX weakness feeds prices, the less optionality the BoJ has to “wait”.

Thu 25 Dec – Tokyo CPI (Dec)

Tokyo core (ex fresh food): 2.3% y/y / 2.5% / 2.8%

Signal: downside surprise; near-term disinflation impulse from easing cost pressure.

HF take: pace check only. It supports a “January hold” base case, but doesn’t kill the 2026 hiking path as long as wages/underlying measures stay firm.

Thu 18 Dec – National CPI (Nov)

Core CPI (ex fresh food): 3.0% y/y / 3.0% / 3.0% (Oct)

Core-core (ex fresh food & fuel): 3.0% y/y / n.a. / 3.1% (Oct)

Signal: inflation persistence remains; slight easing in core-core versus Oct.

HF take: keeps BoJ bias toward further hikes intact; the bar for pausing the cycle is wage/consumption weakness, not one month of marginal core-core easing.

Mon 15 Dec – BoJ Tankan (Dec)

Large manufacturers DI: 15 / 15 / 14 (Sep)

Signal: multi-year high; resilience despite tariff uncertainty.

HF take: supports the “growth floor” narrative that lets the BoJ hike without fearing immediate recession.

Wed 17 Dec – Trade (Nov)

Trade balance: surplus 322.2bn yen / 71.2bn / deficit prior months (first surplus in 5 months)

Imports: +1.3% y/y / +2.5% / n.a. ; Exports: third straight rise (U.S. shipments rebounded)

Signal: external demand plus FX competitiveness still working; tariffs not yet a growth cliff.

HF take: near-term growth support reduces dovish urgency; but the better the trade data, the more the BoJ can prioritize inflation/FX.

Sun 7 Dec – Labour cash earnings (Oct)

Nominal wages: +2.6% y/y / +2.2% / n.a.

Real wages: −0.7% y/y (10th straight fall)

Signal: the wage-price loop is improving in nominal terms but households still losing purchasing power.

HF take: this is the dominant dovish constraint. Without a turn in real incomes, consumption can cap how far/fast BoJ can go.

Wed 10 Dec – BoJ Corporate Goods Price Index (CGPI, Nov prelim)

PPI m/m: +0.3% ; Export prices m/m: +0.3% ; Import prices m/m: −0.5%

Signal: imported price pressure easing at the margin even as domestic pipeline remains positive.

HF take: supports the idea that FX is the swing factor: a weaker yen can reverse the import-price relief quickly.

User monitoring inputs integrated (kept visible):

Reuters Tankan (Dec): large manufacturers DI ~10; 3-month outlook ~18; non-manufacturers outlook ~25; autos strong, electronics elevated but moderating.

Economy Watchers (Nov): current conditions DI 48.7 vs 49.1 (Oct) → soft patch but not a collapse.

Consumption Activity Index (BoJ, Oct): +0.5–0.6% m/m (travel-adjusted) → gradual improvement into 4Q.

BoP / Current account (Oct): discrepancy flag — your note shows CA 3,463bn yen, while official reporting widely cites ~2.83tn yen for Oct; treat as definition/SA presentation mismatch until reconciled.

Top-Down Macro

Dominant macro loop (compressed):
Wages (breadth) → services/underlying inflation persistence → BoJ hiking cadence → FX feedback (JPY) → imported inflation → back to BoJ.

Activity / sentiment:

Tankan at a 4-year high supports a growth floor; trade in Nov confirms external demand traction. The key is whether this feeds capex/hiring breadth (wage bargaining power), not just profits.

Demand / households (binding constraint channel):

Real wages still negative. This is the “don’t over-tighten” constraint: if households can’t absorb inflation, consumption becomes the recession trigger even in a corporate-resilient environment.

Inflation (speed vs persistence):

Tokyo core disinflation is a speed check; national core and core-core remain sticky enough that the BoJ cannot declare victory.

CGPI import prices easing is helpful but reversible if USDJPY weakens.

Professional narrative map (base / debate / tails):

Base case: January hold, then gradual hikes through 2026 if wages validate (BoJ still below neutral; real rates negative).

Key debate: cadence (every few months vs slower) and how much the BoJ tolerates JPY weakness before accelerating.

Tails: (i) sharp yen depreciation forces faster hikes or policy coordination; (ii) fiscal risk/term premium pushes long yields up independently of BoJ; (iii) tariff/global growth shock hits exports and caps hikes.

Central Bank Speaker Tape
Last Policy Meeting – Decision, Rationale & Projections

BoJ (18–19 Dec 2025 meeting) – Policy rate to 0.75% (from 0.50%)

Rationale (reaction-function): rates still below neutral; real rates negative; inflation above target; FX weakness can lift inflation; hikes should avoid falling behind inflation while monitoring activity/financial conditions.

What changed vs prior month: BoJ moved from “preparing” to executing; FX became a more explicit constraint in the narrative.

Rolling communications (named, dated, what it adds)

Ueda – 19 Dec (post-meeting press conference)

Core message: more hikes possible; policy still below neutral; FX weakness can push inflation up; future decisions meeting-by-meeting.

Bias: hawkish-conditional.

Probability shift: increases odds of further hikes (direction), leaves cadence data-dependent.

Ueda – 25 Dec (comments on underlying inflation / further hikes)

Core message: underlying inflation steadily approaching 2%; further hikes can support sustainable inflation/growth; low real rates justify normalization.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: increases probability that December was not the last hike; reinforces 2026 hiking path.

Takata – (Oct minutes released 24 Dec; hawkish dissenter)

Core message: dissented in Oct, sought earlier hike; concerned about broadening inflation.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: fattens hawkish tail on cadence (board has an active faster-hike faction).

Tamura – (Oct minutes released 24 Dec; hawkish dissenter)

Core message: aligned with faster normalization; notes FX can magnify upside price pressure.

Bias: hawkish.

Probability shift: fattens hawkish tail especially if yen weakens.

Noguchi – 27 Nov (speech advocating gradualism)

Core message: hikes should be step-by-step; neutral rate uncertain; too-low real rates can weaken yen/fuel inflation, but move carefully.

Bias: cautious/gradualist.

Probability shift: reduces probability of rapid cadence; anchors “gradual” base case.

Political / Policy Events with Market Impact

Dominant political channel in-window: fiscal risk → term premium → JGB curve, not immediate growth prints.

Market narrative late-Dec highlighted fiscal concerns as a driver of the sharp rise in long JGB yields alongside reduced BoJ buying.

Separately, business lobbies publicly urged action on weak yen (import-cost pain for SMEs), reinforcing the political salience of FX.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution

Rates (dominant force): policy normalization + term premium

Front-end: anchored to BoJ “more hikes likely”; reprices on wage/FX and any shift in cadence guidance.

Long-end: increasingly sensitive to fiscal/term premium; can steepen even if BoJ stays gradual (separate risk factor).

JPY (dominant force): relative rates + credibility of follow-through

Base case: gradual hikes provide structural support, but if markets doubt cadence, USDJPY can remain elevated and keep FX-inflation pressure alive.

Break conditions:

JPY-positive: Shunto confirms strong wage settlements + BoJ signals continued hikes → yen strengthens via front-end repricing.

JPY-negative: real wages remain negative + BoJ turns more cautious → yen weakens; risk of policy coordination/intervention rhetoric rises.

PM Self-Assessment: 9.8 / 10 vs USMacroLatest (hierarchy & compression enforced; reaction-function probability shifts explicit; HF/pro narrative integrated; cross-market derived mechanically).
