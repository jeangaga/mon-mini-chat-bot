EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 5–JAN 9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of WEDNESDAY close (JAN 7)

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

CHINA — RatingDog Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 52.1 vs Cons 52.0 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, this keeps the “services still grinding higher” signal alive — not a re-acceleration, but it leans against the bearish tail where post-property drag finally bleeds into services. Second-order, it matters mainly through confidence/credit impulse optics rather than hard output: if services stays >50, policymakers can keep leaning on targeted easing instead of panic-style stimulus. Market channel: rates/FX via China-growth proxy (CNH + regional cyclicals) rather than domestic inflation (still not the story).

TURKEY — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.89% vs Cons 0.98% vs Prior 0.87%
HF comment: Dominant signal is disinflation progress still inching forward (below consensus) but not a “break” (basically flat vs prior). Second-order is the policy asymmetry: CBT doesn’t need “good” CPI to stay tight — it needs CPI to stop being “bad.” This print reduces near-term urgency for additional tightening without creating room for early easing. Market channel is local rates first (front-end less pressured), and FX via carry credibility (TRY stability depends more on policy consistency + reserves than a single CPI beat).

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC Services Business Activity (Dec)
Actual 58.0 vs Cons 59.3 vs Prior 59.1
HF comment: First-order, this is a growth impulse downshift, but from very hot levels — it’s cooling, not cracking. Second-order is the inflation-growth mix for RBI: softer momentum reduces the risk of demand-led services inflation persistence at the margin, but the level remains consistent with “no urgency to ease.” Market channel: rates (caps hawkish repricing), INR mostly through relative carry/risk-on rather than this one datapoint.

SOUTH AFRICA — Standard Bank Whole Economy PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.0 vs Prior 47.7 (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: still sub-50 contraction, but the direction is less ugly (stabilisation, not recovery). Second-order: SARB reaction function won’t pivot on PMI — it pivots on inflation expectations / FX / wage dynamics — but a less weak activity backdrop slightly reduces the “growth pain” argument for dovish pressure. Market channel: ZAR via risk sentiment, local rates only if this feeds the broader “soft landing vs stagnation” narrative.

BRAZIL — IPC-Fipe Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.32% (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, a downside inflation surprise supports the idea that inflation pressure is not re-igniting in the near term. Second-order is the CB asymmetry: BCB can’t aggressively dovish-reprice on one soft print if inflation expectations / fiscal noise stay sticky — but it does reduce the risk of a hawkish surprise. Market channel: front-end rates (less tightening tail), BRL only if it interacts with fiscal/risk optics.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 50.1 vs Cons 53.7 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is a real growth momentum fade (near-stall speed) — that’s not noise when it’s a big miss. Second-order: this strengthens the “activity is doing the tightening for the BCB” narrative, but only matters for policy if it persists into hard data (employment/credit). Market channel: rates bullish (less hawkish tail), equities cyclicals softer; FX impact conditional on global risk tone.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.6 vs Cons 52.1 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order: composite <50 is a regime warning if confirmed — it’s the sort of print that makes investors reassess “resilient domestic demand.” Second-order: it shifts focus to whether the drag is broad (services-led) or transitory (seasonality / survey noise). Reaction function: raises the bar for further hawkish repricing; doesn’t guarantee easing acceleration. Channel: rates first, BRL second.

BRAZIL — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 9.633B vs Cons 7.100B vs Prior 5.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal is external cushion remains strong — helpful for BRL resilience (buffer against risk-off episodes). Second-order: it does not overturn the domestic growth slowdown implied by PMI; it’s more “stability insurance” than growth fuel. Market channel: FX via balance-of-payments comfort, less about rates.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

TAIWAN — CPI y/y NSA (Dec)
Actual 1.31% vs Cons 1.30% vs Prior 1.23%
HF comment: First-order: inflation remains contained/low, the uptick is marginal — not a regime shift. Second-order: reinforces that Taiwan’s macro debate is still more about trade/tech cycle than CPI constraints. Market channel: limited; any rates impact is small unless the trend accelerates, which this does not prove.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

PREVIEW — SOUTH AFRICA: Net $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Consensus 70.024B (no prior provided)
HF framing: If reserves rise meaningfully, it’s a ZAR tail-risk reducer (buffer + confidence). If flat/down, market will refocus on funding conditions and FX vulnerability. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

PREVIEW — SOUTH AFRICA: Gross $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Consensus 72.068B (no prior provided)
HF framing: Same story — not a growth signal, a risk premium signal.

PREVIEW — TURKEY: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 2.88 (prior/actual not provided)
HF framing: Only matters if it moves sharply — otherwise it’s background noise versus CPI + reserves + policy credibility.

PREVIEW — POLAND: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 7.73 (prior/actual not provided)
HF framing: Market will treat this as context, not catalyst, unless it swings enough to change near-term risk pricing.

PREVIEW — SOUTH AFRICA: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 4.45 (prior/actual not provided)
HF framing: Same — only meaningful if it changes the risk-premium narrative.

PREVIEW — BRAZIL: IGP-DI Inflation Index (Dec)
Consensus 0.15% vs Prior 0.43%
HF framing: Watch for confirmation of pipeline disinflation. Big downside → supports duration; upside → reopens “sticky price pressures” tail, especially if it maps to regulated/food dynamics.

PREVIEW — SOUTH AFRICA: Manufacturing Production m/m (Nov)
Consensus -0.2% vs Prior 0.5%
HF framing: Weak print reinforces stagnation and raises sensitivity to any ZAR shock (less domestic buffer). A beat would be treated as “less bad,” not bullish.

PREVIEW — BRAZIL: Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Consensus 0.2% vs Prior 1.1%
HF framing: Market cares about whether hard data validates the PMI slump. A weak print would upgrade the “growth downshift” to first-order.

PREVIEW — BRAZIL: Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Consensus -0.1% vs Prior 2.0%
HF framing: Same validation logic — y/y rolling over would be taken more seriously than m/m noise.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: Headline Inflation (Dec)
Consensus 0.40% vs Prior 0.52%
HF framing: Key for Banxico is not just headline — it’s whether the print supports gradual disinflation without a core re-acceleration. A downside would keep easing optionality; an upside (esp. core) tightens the reaction function.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: Core Inflation (Dec)
Consensus 0.42% vs Prior 0.62%
HF framing: This is the dominant Mexico inflation signal. A low core print materially de-risks hawkish repricing.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: 12-month Inflation (Dec)
Consensus 3.80% vs Prior 3.94%
HF framing: Mainly a narrative anchor. Market trades the monthly core surprise more than the y/y.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: PPI m/m (Dec)
(no consensus provided)
HF framing: Watch for pipeline pass-through; usually second-order unless it foreshadows CPI persistence.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: PPI y/y (Dec)
Consensus 2.4%
HF framing: Helpful if it confirms benign pipeline; unlikely to move policy alone.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

PREVIEW — CHINA: CPI y/y (Dec)
Consensus 0.9% vs Prior 0.7%
HF framing: Market only cares if CPI surprises enough to shift the deflation narrative. A higher CPI without better activity is still “lowflation,” not overheating.

PREVIEW — CHINA: PPI y/y (Dec)
Consensus -2.0% vs Prior -2.0%
HF framing: Dominant signal is whether producer deflation is sticking. If PPI is less negative, it supports “inventory/policy traction”; if more negative, it keeps the profit squeeze / reflation failure narrative alive. Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals.

PREVIEW — CHINA: CPI m/m (Dec)
Consensus -0.1%
HF framing: Mostly seasonal; only matters if it reinforces a broader disinflation trend.

PREVIEW — CHINA: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 2.28
HF framing: Context-only unless it moves sharply.

PREVIEW — INDIA: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 3.12
HF framing: Context-only; rate/FX trade remains macro + policy expectations-driven.

PREVIEW — THAILAND: Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Consensus 5.10
HF framing: Context-only; watch only if it changes market risk pricing.

PREVIEW — TURKEY: Industrial Production unadj m/m (Nov)
Consensus 0.3%
HF framing: Only market-moving if it contradicts the disinflation/slowdown story. Strong IP + benign CPI would test the “soft landing” narrative; weak IP reinforces tight-policy growth drag.

PREVIEW — TAIWAN: Imports (Dec)
Consensus 28.10% vs Prior 40.90%
HF framing: This is a cycle/semis proxy. A big slowdown would worry macro tourists; pros will still map it to base effects and the electronics cycle.

PREVIEW — TAIWAN: Exports (Dec)
Consensus 46.00% vs Prior 53.70%
HF framing: Same — direction matters for the “AI/semis supercycle” narrative, but volatility is high. Watch for broad-based strength vs single-sector concentration.

PREVIEW — TAIWAN: Trade Balance (Dec)
Consensus 16.100B vs Prior 11.300B
HF framing: Surplus support is FX-positive, but the market trades the export/import impulse more than the level.

PREVIEW — BRAZIL: IPCA m/m (Dec)
Consensus 0.35% vs Prior 0.51%
HF framing: Dominant Brazil inflation event. A downside surprise would reinforce duration bids and soften hawkish tails; upside reopens the “inflation expectations” risk and can reprice the front-end fast.

PREVIEW — BRAZIL: IPCA y/y (Dec)
Consensus 4.30% vs Prior 4.50%
HF framing: Narrative anchor; the market moves on the monthly composition/surprise, but y/y trending lower supports easing.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Consensus -1.2% vs Prior 0.0%
HF framing: If weakness persists, it strengthens the case that growth is the constraint, giving Banxico more cover to ease if core allows.

PREVIEW — MEXICO: Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Consensus 0.0% vs Prior 0.3%
HF framing: More noise than y/y, unless extreme.

PREVIEW — TURKEY: Gross FX Reserves (w/e 2 Jan)
Consensus 76.98B
HF framing: For TRY, reserves are first-order. Rising reserves support carry stability; falling reserves tightens policy credibility constraints.

PREVIEW — TURKEY: Net FX Reserves (w/e 2 Jan)
Consensus 79.77B
HF framing: Same — net matters more than gross for credibility and “defendability” of the regime.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS (partial; enough data for a first cut)

What mattered so far: Brazil’s PMIs (services + composite) are the first real growth-downshift warning, while Brazil’s external balance remains a stabiliser rather than a growth impulse. Turkey CPI is a small downside surprise but keeps the “tight for longer, no panic” reaction function intact. China services PMI modestly supports “stabilisation, not reflation.”
What didn’t: Taiwan CPI is not a constraint. SA PMI improved but still sub-50 — not a pivot signal.
Reaction function shift: so far, Brazil rates bias marginally more dovish via growth risk; Turkey policy bias unchanged (credibility + reserves remain key); China policy still in “targeted support” mode pending CPI/PPI confirmation.
