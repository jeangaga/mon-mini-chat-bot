EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 12–JAN 16, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 16)

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

INDIA — CPI inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 1.33% vs Cons 1.50% vs Prior 0.71%
HF comment: Dominant signal is inflation remains far below target-band “stress” even after the bounce — the downside miss matters because it keeps the RBI’s constraint set anchored to growth/real rates rather than inflation fear. Second-order: the direction (up from 0.71) reminds you the next few prints can move on food/base effects, but this isn’t a regime change unless it spills into core persistence. Reaction function: supports patience / optionality (no need to re-tighten), but doesn’t force an easing sprint absent growth weakness. Channel: front-end rates (limits hawkish repricing), INR mainly via global risk/carry.

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE: Soybean output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 178.00M vs Cons 176.35M vs Prior 175.00M
HF comment: First-order is positive supply shock (bigger crop) — bearish for local ag-price tail risk and supportive for the disinflation impulse into food/terms-of-trade if realised in exports. Second-order: the market won’t price “macro easing” off a single crop estimate; it prices the inflation expectations channel and how it feeds BCB comfort. Transmission: BRL/terms-of-trade + inflation breakevens; local rates benefit if this reinforces the “inflation doesn’t re-accelerate” narrative.

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE: Corn output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 131.00M vs Cons 132.46M vs Prior 131.00M
HF comment: Dominant signal is a small downside supply revision versus consensus (not vs prior), which offsets some of the soybean disinflation comfort at the margin. Second-order: corn matters more for domestic price sensitivity (feed chain) — but the shock size here looks more like noise unless repeated. Channel: limited unless it changes food inflation tails.

BRAZIL — World soy output 24/25 (Jan)
Actual 171.50M (no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Context print; market impact only if it changes the global balance enough to move CBOT and spill into local food/inflation pricing.

BRAZIL — World corn output 24/25 (Jan)
Actual 136.00M (no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Same — global price channel, not a Brazil-demand signal.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

TURKEY — Current account balance (Nov)
Actual -3.996B vs Cons -3.250B vs Prior +0.457B
HF comment: Dominant signal is external deterioration: swing back to a sizeable deficit and worse than expected. In Turkey, this matters because the current account is a credibility constraint: deficits + reserve fragility = the market charges more FX risk premium. Second-order: one month can be volatile, but the prior was a surplus — the direction shift increases sensitivity to any TRY pressure. Reaction function: keeps CBT pinned to tight/credibility-first posture; it can’t sound relaxed even if CPI behaves. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

HUNGARY — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.3% vs Cons 3.3% vs Prior 3.8%
HF comment: Dominant signal: disinflation continues (down from 3.8) with no surprise vs consensus — that’s supportive but not catalyst. Second-order: as inflation drifts lower, the debate shifts to how fast easing can run without FX stress. Channel: rates mildly supportive, FX conditional.

CZECH REPUBLIC — CPI final m/m (Dec)
Actual -0.3% (final; no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Confirmation print; little impulse. Matters only as part of the broader “disinflation intact” backdrop.

CZECH REPUBLIC — CPI final y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.1% (final; no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Confirms inflation near target; not tradable alone.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Current account (Nov)
Actual 8.16B vs Cons 8.67B vs Prior 16.83B
HF comment: Dominant signal is surplus still large but normalising. Second-order: for CZK, levels matter less than whether the external position stops being a buffer — here it remains a buffer. Channel: limited; FX support at the margin.

BRAZIL — Services output m/m (Nov)
Actual -0.1% vs Cons +0.2% vs Prior +0.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal is services momentum fading into Q4 — this matters because services is the domestic-demand core. Missing consensus and turning negative makes the “growth downshift” first-order. Second-order: composition matters: weakness in transport/info-comm is growth-negative and also hints at softer business activity. Reaction function: increases asymmetry toward less restrictive pricing as long as inflation doesn’t re-accelerate. Channel: rates bullish (dovish repricing), equities domestic cyclicals.

POLAND — Current account (Nov)
Actual -460M vs Cons +500M vs Prior +2,053M
HF comment: Dominant signal: swing to deficit vs both consensus and prior — external cushion erodes at the margin. Second-order: one print doesn’t rewrite the regime, but it raises FX sensitivity when global risk turns. Channel: PLN risk premium.

WEDNESDAY 14 — RELEASED

CHINA — Exports y/y (Dec)
Actual +6.6% vs Cons +3.0% vs Prior +5.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal is external demand resilience > expected (big beat). This is the market’s preferred China “growth” channel right now: exports offset domestic demand fragility. Second-order: the market mix matters: non-US strength doing the heavy lifting implies geopolitical/US drag is being diversified away, but it also reinforces the “surplus politics” tail. Reaction function: reduces near-term urgency for shock stimulus; keeps policy in “targeted + fiscal execution” mode. Channel: CNH + EM beta via risk sentiment, and global rates via growth optics only at the margin.

CHINA — Imports y/y (Dec)
Actual +5.7% vs Cons +0.9% vs Prior +1.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal is domestic absorption better than priced (also a beat). First-order takeaway: the “China demand is dead” narrative softens. Second-order: imports can be price/commodity driven — the key is whether this aligns with credit impulse (see TSF/loans). Channel: commodities + EM cyclicals; CNH supportive.

CHINA — Trade balance (USD, Dec)
Actual 114.10B vs Cons 113.60B vs Prior 111.68B
HF comment: Dominant signal: surplus remains very large and persistent — supportive for CNH stability but politically sensitive. Second-order: for markets, the rate of change in trade impulse matters more than the level; here impulse is strong. Channel: CNH + regional risk.

INDIA — WPI inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.83% vs Cons 0.30% vs Prior -0.32%
HF comment: Dominant signal is upstream inflation bounced hard (big upside vs consensus) — this is a second-order risk to the “India disinflation is effortless” story. But: WPI is not CPI; the key is whether it’s food/pimary-articles driven and whether it spills into retail inflation persistence. Reaction function: RBI won’t react to WPI alone, but it tightens the easing asymmetry if it foreshadows a CPI turn. Channel: rates (limits dovish repricing), INR marginal.

POLAND — NBP base rate (Jan)
Actual 4.00% vs Cons 4.00% vs Prior 4.00%
HF comment: No impulse; confirms status quo. Market trades guidance and inflation path.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

CHINA — Total Social Financing (Dec)
Actual 2,210B vs Cons 2,000B vs Prior 2,490B
HF comment: Dominant signal: credit creation beat expectations (even if down from prior), which is important because China trades on the credit impulse, not the level. Second-order: the fact it’s below prior suggests no “flood,” more like targeted/managed support. Reaction function: consistent with “ample liquidity + fiscal doing the heavy lifting.” Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals; domestic rates less.

CHINA — M2 money supply y/y (Dec)
Actual 8.5% vs Cons 8.0% vs Prior 8.0%
HF comment: Dominant signal: liquidity conditions remain accommodative. Second-order: M2 can rise while private credit appetite is weak (high savings / cautious sentiment) — so treat as necessary but not sufficient. Channel: supports risk sentiment; limited direct market impulse.

CHINA — New yuan loans (Dec)
Actual 910B vs Cons 800B vs Prior 390B
HF comment: Dominant signal: credit flow stronger than expected, and the jump vs prior is meaningful. Second-order: composition matters (household vs corporate; short vs long). Reaction function: strengthens the case that policy is getting some traction without forcing a broad stimulus pivot. Channel: equity/risk beta > rates.

CHINA — Outstanding loan growth y/y (Dec)
Actual 6.4% vs Cons 6.3% vs Prior 6.4%
HF comment: Flat trend → no new information. It tells you the system isn’t accelerating structurally; impulses come through flow measures (TSF/loans), not the stock.

SOUTH KOREA — BoK base rate (Jan)
Actual 2.50% vs Cons 2.50% vs Prior 2.50%
HF comment: No impulse; confirms BoK patience. Market impact through forward guidance/risk, not the decision.

POLAND — CPI final m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.00% (final)
HF comment: Confirmation print; no impulse.

POLAND — CPI final y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.40% (final)
HF comment: Confirms low inflation; tradability low absent guidance shift.

INDIA — Unemployment rate (Dec)
Actual 4.80% vs Cons 4.80% vs Prior 4.70%
HF comment: Dominant signal: labor market stable — not a growth scare, not a boom. Second-order: it doesn’t loosen the RBI constraint set; it just reduces tail risk of abrupt demand weakness. Channel: minimal.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Retail sales WDA y/y (Nov)
Actual 4.6% vs Cons 3.4% vs Prior 2.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: consumption momentum stronger than expected. Second-order: strengthens the “soft landing” domestic demand story; can slow the pace of dovish repricing if the CNB debate is about easing speed. Channel: rates/FX mild.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Retail sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 2.7% vs Cons 1.5% (no prior provided)
HF comment: Same direction; confirms upside demand surprise.

BRAZIL — Retail sales m/m (Nov)
Actual 1.0% vs Cons 0.3% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: consumption resilience (clear beat). This is the counterweight to weak services output and soft industrial trend: the Brazil story is mixed, not one-way down. Second-order: retail strength can keep services inflation tails alive — but only if it persists. Reaction function: reduces probability of an aggressive dovish swing; supports “gradualism.” Channel: rates (limits dovish repricing), equities consumer.

BRAZIL — Retail sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 1.30% vs Cons 0.20% vs Prior 1.10%
HF comment: Reinforces the same: demand not collapsing. Market will reconcile this with weak services by focusing on composition and timing.

TURKEY — Gross FX reserves (w/e 5 Jan)
Actual 79.35B vs Prior 74.56B (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: reserve rebuild — crucial after last week’s disappointment. In Turkey, reserves are first-order because they determine how much credibility cushion exists for the FX regime. Second-order: one week doesn’t “fix” the story; the market needs persistence. Reaction function: gives CBT slightly more room to stay stable (and less risk of forced hawkish reaction), but doesn’t create dovish freedom. Channel: TRY support, risk premium compresses.

TURKEY — Net FX reserves (w/e 5 Jan)
Actual 82.93B vs Prior 76.89B (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Even more important than gross: net up materially is a credibility positive. This directly offsets the current-account negative from Tuesday, but doesn’t erase it — it just reduces near-term stress probability. Channel: FX first, then rates.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IBC-Br economic activity m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.70% vs Cons 0.30% vs Prior -0.20%
HF comment: Dominant signal: hard activity rebounded more than expected (and from a weak prior) — this meaningfully reduces “Q4 contraction” tails. Second-order: this forces a repricing of the earlier bearish read from services output: the regime is closer to “choppy stabilisation” than “clean downturn.” Reaction function: makes it harder to price a fast BCB dovish pivot unless inflation collapses; supports gradualism. Channel: rates (less dovish), equities/BRL mildly supportive.

POLAND — Net inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.70% vs Cons 2.80% vs Prior 2.70%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation still contained; mild downside vs consensus is not a catalyst. Channel: minimal unless it alters forward guidance dynamics.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

China (trade + credit): Big beats in exports/imports and stronger-than-expected TSF/loans were the week’s core EM impulse — “China not worsening” with a modest credit impulse, supporting CNH and EM beta through risk sentiment.

Brazil (activity cross-currents): Services output was a genuine downside signal, but retail + IBC-Br pushed back hard. Net: Brazil is stabilising with volatility, not a clean downshift — this caps aggressive dovish pricing unless inflation provides a stronger green light.

Turkey (external vs reserves tug-of-war): Current account deterioration was negative, but the reserve rebuild late-week is first-order positive. Net: TRY risk premium becomes more two-sided again — still credibility-driven, but less one-way stress.

What did NOT:

Rates decisions (BoK, NBP) were pure holds with no new impulse.

Most “final” CPI prints in CEE were confirmation, not catalysts.

Reaction-function shifts:

RBI: CPI downside surprise keeps policy optionality; WPI upside is a caution flag, not a trigger — net still “patient.”

BCB: Hard activity resilience (IBC-Br) pushes against an aggressive dovish narrative; easing expectations remain data-dependent on inflation and sustained softness.

China policy: Data supports the stance of targeted monetary support + fiscal execution rather than shock stimulus.

CBT: Reserves improved, which reduces forced-hawk risk, but external balance volatility keeps credibility as the binding constraint.

EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 5–JAN 9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 9)

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

CHINA — RatingDog Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 52.1 vs Cons 52.0 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, this keeps the “services still grinding higher” signal alive — not a re-acceleration, but it leans against the bearish tail where post-property drag finally bleeds into services. Second-order, it matters mainly through confidence/credit impulse optics rather than hard output: if services stays >50, policymakers can keep leaning on targeted easing instead of panic-style stimulus. Market channel: rates/FX via China-growth proxy (CNH + regional cyclicals) rather than domestic inflation.

TURKEY — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.89% vs Cons 0.98% vs Prior 0.87%
HF comment: Dominant signal is incremental disinflation (below consensus) without a “break” (near prior). Second-order is the policy asymmetry: CBT doesn’t need “good” CPI to stay tight — it needs CPI to stop being “bad.” This print reduces near-term urgency for additional tightening without creating room for early easing. Market channel: front-end rates first, FX via carry credibility (TRY stability remains more about policy consistency + reserves than a single CPI beat).

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC Services Business Activity (Dec)
Actual 58.0 vs Cons 59.3 vs Prior 59.1
HF comment: First-order, this is a growth impulse downshift, but from very hot levels — cooling, not cracking. Second-order: marginally lowers the risk that demand-side services inflation stays sticky, but not enough to change “no urgency to ease.” Market channel: rates (caps hawkish repricing), INR mostly via global risk/carry rather than this print.

SOUTH AFRICA — Standard Bank Whole Economy PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.0 vs Prior 47.7 (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: still sub-50 contraction, but the direction is less ugly (stabilisation, not recovery). Second-order: SARB won’t pivot on PMI, but a less weak activity backdrop slightly reduces the “growth pain” case for dovish pressure. Channel: ZAR via risk sentiment, rates only if it feeds a broader “less bad” sequence.

BRAZIL — IPC-Fipe Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.32% (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, downside surprise supports the view inflation pressure is not re-igniting near term. Second-order: it reduces the hawkish tail but doesn’t buy BCB “freedom” if expectations/fiscal noise remain the binding constraint. Channel: front-end rates.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 50.1 vs Cons 53.7 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is services momentum lost (near stall) — big miss, hard to hand-wave. Second-order: strengthens “tight policy working through demand” narrative; needs hard-data confirmation to become regime. Channel: rates bullish, BRL conditional on risk tone.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.6 vs Cons 52.1 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order: composite <50 is a regime-warning if it persists. Second-order: market will quickly test whether this is breadth (demand) vs survey noise. Reaction function: lowers probability of hawkish repricing; doesn’t automatically accelerate easing without inflation confirmation. Channel: rates first, equities cyclicals second, BRL third.

BRAZIL — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 9.633B vs Cons 7.100B vs Prior 5.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal: external cushion strong — supportive for BRL resilience and risk premium. Second-order: does not offset domestic growth downshift implied by PMIs; it’s insurance, not growth fuel. Channel: FX via balance-of-payments comfort.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

TAIWAN — CPI y/y NSA (Dec)
Actual 1.31% vs Cons 1.30% vs Prior 1.23%
HF comment: First-order: inflation remains contained; marginal uptick isn’t a constraint. Second-order: keeps the focus on the tech/trade cycle rather than CPI-driven policy. Channel: limited.

BRAZIL — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.87 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Treat as context, not catalyst. It only matters if it changes risk pricing in a way that spills into rates/FX — otherwise it’s background noise versus growth (PMIs) + inflation (IPCA) + fiscal headlines.

MEXICO — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.29 vs Cons 4.30 vs Prior 4.30
HF comment: Tiny downside vs consensus is non-event. Mexico trades on inflation-core credibility + growth prints; this doesn’t move the reaction function.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

SOUTH AFRICA — Net $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 71.144B vs Cons 70.024B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is a meaningful buffer improvement — positive for ZAR tail risk (funding/carry confidence). Second-order: if driven by valuation vs flows is the key nuance, but either way it reduces “fragility premium” at the margin. Channel: FX first, then local rates via lower risk premium.

SOUTH AFRICA — Gross $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 75.892B vs Cons 72.068B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Confirms the same story: headline reserve optics improved. Market cares less about level than trajectory when positioning is fragile; this helps stabilize the risk narrative.

TURKEY — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.86 vs Cons 2.88 vs Prior 2.87
HF comment: Not a catalyst. If anything, marginally “less risky” at the edges, but TRY trades on policy path + reserves; this does not substitute.

POLAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 7.73 vs Cons 7.73 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Pure placeholder; no impulse.

SOUTH AFRICA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.44 vs Cons 4.45 vs Prior 4.44
HF comment: Flat → no information content. Ignore.

BRAZIL — IGP-DI Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.10% vs Cons 0.15% vs Prior 0.01%
HF comment: First-order, pipeline inflation remains benign (below consensus), consistent with less pressure on downstream prices. Second-order: IGP can be noisy (commodities/FX pass-through), so the market uses it as confirmation rather than a driver — but in a week where growth is wobbling (PMIs), benign pipeline inflation strengthens the duration bid and reduces the hawkish tail. Channel: rates (front-end + belly).

SOUTH AFRICA — Manufacturing Production m/m (Nov)
Actual -1.1% vs Cons -0.2% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal is hard growth weakness — this is not “just survey.” Second-order: increases asymmetry in SARB debate: even if inflation is the mandate, weak activity raises political/market pressure against further hawkishness. Channel: rates bull-steepening risk (front-end relief) but watch ZAR: weak growth can increase FX sensitivity if risk-off hits.

TURKEY — Gross FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 74.56B vs Cons 76.98B (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order negative for TRY optics — reserves are the binding credibility constraint. Second-order: one week doesn’t make a trend, but it raises sensitivity to any policy/macro disappointment: when reserves wobble, the market demands higher carry/vol premium. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

TURKEY — Net FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 76.89B vs Cons 79.77B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Same direction, worse implication: net matters more for “defendability.” Dominant signal: credibility buffer is not steadily building. Second-order: this makes CBT more reluctant to signal dovishness even if CPI prints nicer. Channel: TRY + front-end via credibility.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.0% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior 0.1%
HF comment: First-order: soft/flat — mild confirmation that the PMI slump isn’t pure noise, though the miss is small. Second-order: m/m is noisy; what matters is whether a run of prints starts to map into employment/credit. Channel: modest rates supportive.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -1.2% vs Cons -0.1% vs Prior -0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: this is a clear deterioration and validates the “growth downshift” narrative (now in hard data). Second-order: with growth weakening and pipeline inflation benign (IGP), the reaction-function balance tilts toward less restrictive pricing unless IPCA re-accelerates. Channel: rates (dovish repricing), equities cyclical risk, BRL depends on global risk + fiscal.

MEXICO — Headline Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.28% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.66%
HF comment: First-order disinflation is back on track. Second-order: headline matters less than core for Banxico, but a soft headline reduces pressure on the narrative and lowers the risk premium embedded in rates. Channel: rates supportive, FX mildly positive via carry stability.

MEXICO — Core Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.42% vs Prior 0.19%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core is not collapsing — it’s basically as expected and higher than prior. This is the “check” on dovish extrapolation: you can’t declare victory. Second-order: the combo (soft headline, steady core) supports a gradual easing path rather than aggressive cuts. Channel: front-end (keeps easing priced but limits acceleration), MXN stable.

MEXICO — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.69% vs Cons 3.80% vs Prior 3.80%
HF comment: First-order: y/y drift lower supports the disinflation story. Second-order: market still trades monthly core more than this level, but it helps anchor medium-term expectations. Channel: low-to-moderate rates support.

MEXICO — PPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.5% (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Second-order. Without context it’s not tradable; watch only if it starts feeding a trend that reappears in CPI goods.

MEXICO — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.1% vs Cons 2.4%
HF comment: Marginally softer pipeline — supportive for the “no reflation shock” view, but still secondary versus core CPI.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

CHINA — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual -1.9% vs Cons -2.0% vs Prior -2.2%
HF comment: Dominant signal: producer deflation is less negative — modest reflation progress at the margin. Second-order: this is still deflationary, so it doesn’t change the policy regime; it just slightly reduces the “profit squeeze” tail risk. Reaction function: keeps room for support, but less urgency than when PPI was accelerating down. Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals via “China isn’t worsening” optics.

CHINA — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.8% vs Cons 0.8% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: First-order: CPI remains lowflation — no demand overheating signal, no constraint on easing. Second-order: stable/low CPI plus less-negative PPI is the “best possible” configuration for authorities: room to stimulate without an inflation penalty, while signaling incremental traction. Channel: muted; helps risk assets more through narrative than through rates.

CHINA — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.2% vs Cons 0.1% vs Prior -0.1%
HF comment: Mostly second-order/seasonal. Directionally consistent with “deflation scare not intensifying,” but not regime-changing on its own.

CHINA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.28 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

INDIA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 3.12 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

THAILAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 5.10 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

TURKEY — Industrial Production unadj m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.4% vs Cons -1.8% vs Prior 0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: activity did not roll over as feared (huge beat vs consensus). Second-order: in Turkey this creates a policy tension: CPI is edging better, but growth resilience + reserve slippage means CBT cannot relax credibility posture. Net: reduces “hard landing” concerns but doesn’t buy dovishness. Channel: local equities/growth optics positive; rates/FX still dominated by reserves.

TAIWAN — Imports y/y (Dec)
Actual 14.90% vs Cons 28.10% vs Prior 45.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: cycle momentum cooled sharply (big downside miss). Second-order: still strong in absolute terms, but the rate-of-change matters for semiconductor-cycle narratives. Channel: regional equities/tech beta; FX modest.

TAIWAN — Exports y/y (Dec)
Actual 43.40% vs Cons 46.00% vs Prior 56.00%
HF comment: First-order: still very strong, but decelerating. Second-order: the pair with imports (both slowing) leans toward “cycle normalising,” not collapsing. Channel: equities/tech beta > rates.

TAIWAN — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 19.430B vs Cons 16.100B vs Prior 16.090B
HF comment: Dominant signal: surplus bigger than expected supports TWD carry/defensive profile. Second-order: surplus can widen even as growth impulse cools; don’t confuse level with momentum. Channel: FX supportive, modest.

BRAZIL — IPCA m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.33% vs Cons 0.35% vs Prior 0.18%
HF comment: Dominant signal: slight downside vs consensus, but inflation is higher than prior — so not a clean disinflation impulse. Second-order: in a week where growth is weakening (PMIs + industrial y/y), the market can live with “not worse than feared” inflation; what would hurt is an upside surprise that reanchors expectations higher. Reaction function: keeps easing/neutral bias intact; doesn’t force hawkish repricing. Channel: rates supportive, but less powerful than if m/m had fallen vs prior.

BRAZIL — IPCA y/y (Dec)
Actual 4.26% vs Cons 4.30% vs Prior 4.46%
HF comment: First-order: trend down continues — supportive. Second-order: y/y helps expectations anchoring; the market still trades the monthly composition, but this reduces hawkish tail risk. Channel: rates.

MEXICO — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -0.8% vs Cons -1.2% vs Prior -0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: still negative growth, but less weak than feared. Second-order: doesn’t overturn the “soft activity” story; it just reduces the hard-landing tail. Reaction function: keeps Banxico easing optionality alive as long as core behaves. Channel: modestly supportive for MXN (risk), rates steady.

MEXICO — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.6% vs Cons 0.0% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: m/m beat is supportive but second-order; the y/y trend is what matters for regime. Useful mainly as confirmation that the downside growth narrative isn’t accelerating.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

Brazil: The week was about growth downside becoming first-order (PMIs collapsing into <50 + industrial output y/y worsening). Inflation didn’t “save” the hawkish tail, and pipeline inflation stayed benign (IGP-DI). Net: market bias shifts toward dovish repricing in rates unless fiscal shocks intervene.

Mexico: Inflation mix was the key — headline soft, core steady/firm → supports gradual easing, not a dovish stampede. Activity prints helped reduce hard-landing tails but didn’t flip the regime.

Turkey: CPI slightly better, but reserves disappointment is the binding constraint. IP surprise beat reduces growth fear but tightens the credibility asymmetry: CBT can’t afford to sound dovish while reserves wobble.

China: CPI still low, PPI less negative — “stabilisation without inflation constraint.” Supports risk sentiment at the margin, but not a “reflation regime shift.”

What did NOT matter:

“Overall Comprehensive Risk” prints were non-catalysts across countries (no material signal unless they swing hard).

Taiwan CPI didn’t constrain anything; Taiwan trade momentum mattered more than price.

Reaction-function shifts (or not):

BCB: growth shock upgrades dovish asymmetry; inflation data did not fight it.

Banxico: disinflation continues, but core keeps the committee cautious → path remains gradual.

CBT: credibility/reserves dominate; easing talk remains constrained even with softer CPI.
