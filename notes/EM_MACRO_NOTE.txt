EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 5–JAN 9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 9)

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

CHINA — RatingDog Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 52.1 vs Cons 52.0 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, this keeps the “services still grinding higher” signal alive — not a re-acceleration, but it leans against the bearish tail where post-property drag finally bleeds into services. Second-order, it matters mainly through confidence/credit impulse optics rather than hard output: if services stays >50, policymakers can keep leaning on targeted easing instead of panic-style stimulus. Market channel: rates/FX via China-growth proxy (CNH + regional cyclicals) rather than domestic inflation.

TURKEY — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.89% vs Cons 0.98% vs Prior 0.87%
HF comment: Dominant signal is incremental disinflation (below consensus) without a “break” (near prior). Second-order is the policy asymmetry: CBT doesn’t need “good” CPI to stay tight — it needs CPI to stop being “bad.” This print reduces near-term urgency for additional tightening without creating room for early easing. Market channel: front-end rates first, FX via carry credibility (TRY stability remains more about policy consistency + reserves than a single CPI beat).

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC Services Business Activity (Dec)
Actual 58.0 vs Cons 59.3 vs Prior 59.1
HF comment: First-order, this is a growth impulse downshift, but from very hot levels — cooling, not cracking. Second-order: marginally lowers the risk that demand-side services inflation stays sticky, but not enough to change “no urgency to ease.” Market channel: rates (caps hawkish repricing), INR mostly via global risk/carry rather than this print.

SOUTH AFRICA — Standard Bank Whole Economy PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.0 vs Prior 47.7 (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: still sub-50 contraction, but the direction is less ugly (stabilisation, not recovery). Second-order: SARB won’t pivot on PMI, but a less weak activity backdrop slightly reduces the “growth pain” case for dovish pressure. Channel: ZAR via risk sentiment, rates only if it feeds a broader “less bad” sequence.

BRAZIL — IPC-Fipe Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.32% (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, downside surprise supports the view inflation pressure is not re-igniting near term. Second-order: it reduces the hawkish tail but doesn’t buy BCB “freedom” if expectations/fiscal noise remain the binding constraint. Channel: front-end rates.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 50.1 vs Cons 53.7 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is services momentum lost (near stall) — big miss, hard to hand-wave. Second-order: strengthens “tight policy working through demand” narrative; needs hard-data confirmation to become regime. Channel: rates bullish, BRL conditional on risk tone.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.6 vs Cons 52.1 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order: composite <50 is a regime-warning if it persists. Second-order: market will quickly test whether this is breadth (demand) vs survey noise. Reaction function: lowers probability of hawkish repricing; doesn’t automatically accelerate easing without inflation confirmation. Channel: rates first, equities cyclicals second, BRL third.

BRAZIL — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 9.633B vs Cons 7.100B vs Prior 5.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal: external cushion strong — supportive for BRL resilience and risk premium. Second-order: does not offset domestic growth downshift implied by PMIs; it’s insurance, not growth fuel. Channel: FX via balance-of-payments comfort.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

TAIWAN — CPI y/y NSA (Dec)
Actual 1.31% vs Cons 1.30% vs Prior 1.23%
HF comment: First-order: inflation remains contained; marginal uptick isn’t a constraint. Second-order: keeps the focus on the tech/trade cycle rather than CPI-driven policy. Channel: limited.

BRAZIL — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.87 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Treat as context, not catalyst. It only matters if it changes risk pricing in a way that spills into rates/FX — otherwise it’s background noise versus growth (PMIs) + inflation (IPCA) + fiscal headlines.

MEXICO — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.29 vs Cons 4.30 vs Prior 4.30
HF comment: Tiny downside vs consensus is non-event. Mexico trades on inflation-core credibility + growth prints; this doesn’t move the reaction function.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

SOUTH AFRICA — Net $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 71.144B vs Cons 70.024B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is a meaningful buffer improvement — positive for ZAR tail risk (funding/carry confidence). Second-order: if driven by valuation vs flows is the key nuance, but either way it reduces “fragility premium” at the margin. Channel: FX first, then local rates via lower risk premium.

SOUTH AFRICA — Gross $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 75.892B vs Cons 72.068B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Confirms the same story: headline reserve optics improved. Market cares less about level than trajectory when positioning is fragile; this helps stabilize the risk narrative.

TURKEY — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.86 vs Cons 2.88 vs Prior 2.87
HF comment: Not a catalyst. If anything, marginally “less risky” at the edges, but TRY trades on policy path + reserves; this does not substitute.

POLAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 7.73 vs Cons 7.73 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Pure placeholder; no impulse.

SOUTH AFRICA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.44 vs Cons 4.45 vs Prior 4.44
HF comment: Flat → no information content. Ignore.

BRAZIL — IGP-DI Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.10% vs Cons 0.15% vs Prior 0.01%
HF comment: First-order, pipeline inflation remains benign (below consensus), consistent with less pressure on downstream prices. Second-order: IGP can be noisy (commodities/FX pass-through), so the market uses it as confirmation rather than a driver — but in a week where growth is wobbling (PMIs), benign pipeline inflation strengthens the duration bid and reduces the hawkish tail. Channel: rates (front-end + belly).

SOUTH AFRICA — Manufacturing Production m/m (Nov)
Actual -1.1% vs Cons -0.2% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal is hard growth weakness — this is not “just survey.” Second-order: increases asymmetry in SARB debate: even if inflation is the mandate, weak activity raises political/market pressure against further hawkishness. Channel: rates bull-steepening risk (front-end relief) but watch ZAR: weak growth can increase FX sensitivity if risk-off hits.

TURKEY — Gross FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 74.56B vs Cons 76.98B (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order negative for TRY optics — reserves are the binding credibility constraint. Second-order: one week doesn’t make a trend, but it raises sensitivity to any policy/macro disappointment: when reserves wobble, the market demands higher carry/vol premium. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

TURKEY — Net FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 76.89B vs Cons 79.77B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Same direction, worse implication: net matters more for “defendability.” Dominant signal: credibility buffer is not steadily building. Second-order: this makes CBT more reluctant to signal dovishness even if CPI prints nicer. Channel: TRY + front-end via credibility.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.0% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior 0.1%
HF comment: First-order: soft/flat — mild confirmation that the PMI slump isn’t pure noise, though the miss is small. Second-order: m/m is noisy; what matters is whether a run of prints starts to map into employment/credit. Channel: modest rates supportive.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -1.2% vs Cons -0.1% vs Prior -0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: this is a clear deterioration and validates the “growth downshift” narrative (now in hard data). Second-order: with growth weakening and pipeline inflation benign (IGP), the reaction-function balance tilts toward less restrictive pricing unless IPCA re-accelerates. Channel: rates (dovish repricing), equities cyclical risk, BRL depends on global risk + fiscal.

MEXICO — Headline Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.28% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.66%
HF comment: First-order disinflation is back on track. Second-order: headline matters less than core for Banxico, but a soft headline reduces pressure on the narrative and lowers the risk premium embedded in rates. Channel: rates supportive, FX mildly positive via carry stability.

MEXICO — Core Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.42% vs Prior 0.19%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core is not collapsing — it’s basically as expected and higher than prior. This is the “check” on dovish extrapolation: you can’t declare victory. Second-order: the combo (soft headline, steady core) supports a gradual easing path rather than aggressive cuts. Channel: front-end (keeps easing priced but limits acceleration), MXN stable.

MEXICO — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.69% vs Cons 3.80% vs Prior 3.80%
HF comment: First-order: y/y drift lower supports the disinflation story. Second-order: market still trades monthly core more than this level, but it helps anchor medium-term expectations. Channel: low-to-moderate rates support.

MEXICO — PPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.5% (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Second-order. Without context it’s not tradable; watch only if it starts feeding a trend that reappears in CPI goods.

MEXICO — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.1% vs Cons 2.4%
HF comment: Marginally softer pipeline — supportive for the “no reflation shock” view, but still secondary versus core CPI.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

CHINA — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual -1.9% vs Cons -2.0% vs Prior -2.2%
HF comment: Dominant signal: producer deflation is less negative — modest reflation progress at the margin. Second-order: this is still deflationary, so it doesn’t change the policy regime; it just slightly reduces the “profit squeeze” tail risk. Reaction function: keeps room for support, but less urgency than when PPI was accelerating down. Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals via “China isn’t worsening” optics.

CHINA — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.8% vs Cons 0.8% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: First-order: CPI remains lowflation — no demand overheating signal, no constraint on easing. Second-order: stable/low CPI plus less-negative PPI is the “best possible” configuration for authorities: room to stimulate without an inflation penalty, while signaling incremental traction. Channel: muted; helps risk assets more through narrative than through rates.

CHINA — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.2% vs Cons 0.1% vs Prior -0.1%
HF comment: Mostly second-order/seasonal. Directionally consistent with “deflation scare not intensifying,” but not regime-changing on its own.

CHINA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.28 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

INDIA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 3.12 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

THAILAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 5.10 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

TURKEY — Industrial Production unadj m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.4% vs Cons -1.8% vs Prior 0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: activity did not roll over as feared (huge beat vs consensus). Second-order: in Turkey this creates a policy tension: CPI is edging better, but growth resilience + reserve slippage means CBT cannot relax credibility posture. Net: reduces “hard landing” concerns but doesn’t buy dovishness. Channel: local equities/growth optics positive; rates/FX still dominated by reserves.

TAIWAN — Imports y/y (Dec)
Actual 14.90% vs Cons 28.10% vs Prior 45.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: cycle momentum cooled sharply (big downside miss). Second-order: still strong in absolute terms, but the rate-of-change matters for semiconductor-cycle narratives. Channel: regional equities/tech beta; FX modest.

TAIWAN — Exports y/y (Dec)
Actual 43.40% vs Cons 46.00% vs Prior 56.00%
HF comment: First-order: still very strong, but decelerating. Second-order: the pair with imports (both slowing) leans toward “cycle normalising,” not collapsing. Channel: equities/tech beta > rates.

TAIWAN — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 19.430B vs Cons 16.100B vs Prior 16.090B
HF comment: Dominant signal: surplus bigger than expected supports TWD carry/defensive profile. Second-order: surplus can widen even as growth impulse cools; don’t confuse level with momentum. Channel: FX supportive, modest.

BRAZIL — IPCA m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.33% vs Cons 0.35% vs Prior 0.18%
HF comment: Dominant signal: slight downside vs consensus, but inflation is higher than prior — so not a clean disinflation impulse. Second-order: in a week where growth is weakening (PMIs + industrial y/y), the market can live with “not worse than feared” inflation; what would hurt is an upside surprise that reanchors expectations higher. Reaction function: keeps easing/neutral bias intact; doesn’t force hawkish repricing. Channel: rates supportive, but less powerful than if m/m had fallen vs prior.

BRAZIL — IPCA y/y (Dec)
Actual 4.26% vs Cons 4.30% vs Prior 4.46%
HF comment: First-order: trend down continues — supportive. Second-order: y/y helps expectations anchoring; the market still trades the monthly composition, but this reduces hawkish tail risk. Channel: rates.

MEXICO — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -0.8% vs Cons -1.2% vs Prior -0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: still negative growth, but less weak than feared. Second-order: doesn’t overturn the “soft activity” story; it just reduces the hard-landing tail. Reaction function: keeps Banxico easing optionality alive as long as core behaves. Channel: modestly supportive for MXN (risk), rates steady.

MEXICO — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.6% vs Cons 0.0% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: m/m beat is supportive but second-order; the y/y trend is what matters for regime. Useful mainly as confirmation that the downside growth narrative isn’t accelerating.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

Brazil: The week was about growth downside becoming first-order (PMIs collapsing into <50 + industrial output y/y worsening). Inflation didn’t “save” the hawkish tail, and pipeline inflation stayed benign (IGP-DI). Net: market bias shifts toward dovish repricing in rates unless fiscal shocks intervene.

Mexico: Inflation mix was the key — headline soft, core steady/firm → supports gradual easing, not a dovish stampede. Activity prints helped reduce hard-landing tails but didn’t flip the regime.

Turkey: CPI slightly better, but reserves disappointment is the binding constraint. IP surprise beat reduces growth fear but tightens the credibility asymmetry: CBT can’t afford to sound dovish while reserves wobble.

China: CPI still low, PPI less negative — “stabilisation without inflation constraint.” Supports risk sentiment at the margin, but not a “reflation regime shift.”

What did NOT matter:

“Overall Comprehensive Risk” prints were non-catalysts across countries (no material signal unless they swing hard).

Taiwan CPI didn’t constrain anything; Taiwan trade momentum mattered more than price.

Reaction-function shifts (or not):

BCB: growth shock upgrades dovish asymmetry; inflation data did not fight it.

Banxico: disinflation continues, but core keeps the committee cautious → path remains gradual.

CBT: credibility/reserves dominate; easing talk remains constrained even with softer CPI.

China: policy retains room for support; no inflation penalty, but no clear demand re-acceleration either.
