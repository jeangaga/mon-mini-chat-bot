================================================================================
LIVE EMERGING MARKETS MACRO NOTE — WEEK 2 (FEB 2-6, 2026)
================================================================================

REGIME CONTEXT (from Week 1 Jan 23-30):
• EM DIVERGENCE EXTREME — India/Taiwan booming (IP 7.8%, GDP 12.68%) with benign inflation
• China: NBS PMI 49.3 (back to contraction), domestic demand collapse
• Turkey: Reserves +6.36B (credibility rebuild), inflation decelerating
• Brazil: Selic 15.00% hold, dovish pivot coming (growth softening)
• Mexico: IGAE -0.1% (major miss), Banxico gradual easing
• Cross-EM hierarchy: India/Taiwan Tier 1, Turkey/SA Tier 2, China/Brazil/Mexico Tier 3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEEK 2 SUMMARY (FEB 2-6, 2026): TURKEY CRISIS + TAIWAN DISINFLATION PUZZLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOMINANT THEME: Turkey credibility crisis emerging (CPI 4.84% MM spike + reserves REVERSAL) vs Taiwan disinflation deepening (CPI 0.69% despite GDP 12.68%) = EM bifurcation intensifying

KEY EVENTS:
1. TURKEY: CPI 4.84% MM vs 4.32% consensus (MASSIVE spike from 0.89% prior) + methodology change
2. TURKEY: Net reserves REVERSED to 93.36B vs 97.37B prior (-4.01B = credibility risk)
3. TAIWAN: CPI 0.69% YY vs 1.20% consensus (MAJOR disinflation despite GDP boom)
4. INDIA: RBI hold 5.25% all rates UNANIMOUS (growth 7.4%, CPI 2.1% = "Goldilocks")
5. MEXICO: Banxico hold 7.00% UNANIMOUS (easing cycle paused, core sticky 4.47%)
6. CHINA: Caixin PMI 50.3 vs NBS 49.3 (state/private divergence confirmed)
7. SOUTH KOREA: CPI 2.0% vs 2.3% prior (disinflation to BoK target)
8. BRAZIL: Industrial Output -1.2% MM (contraction)

REGIME SHIFT:
• PRIOR: "EM divergence extreme - India/Taiwan boom vs China/Brazil/Mexico stress"
• UPDATED: **"EM POLARIZATION ACCELERATING — India/Taiwan 'perfect combo' (growth + disinflation); Turkey CRISIS MODE (hyperinflation return + reserve collapse); China/Brazil/Mexico dovish pivot confirmed; central bank divergence at MAXIMUM"**

CROSS-EM FX IMPLICATIONS:
→ TRY now HIGH RISK (reserves falling, CPI accelerating, methodology doubts)
→ TWD/INR strongest (disinflation + growth)
→ CNH/BRL/MXN weakening pressure (dovish pivots)

MAJOR EVENTS — DETAILED HF COMMENTARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MONDAY 02 FEB — RELEASED

SOUTH KOREA — CPI (Jan)
• Actual: 2.0% YY vs Prior: 2.3%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Korea CPI 2.0% = AT BoK TARGET (2.0%) for first time in months, giving BoK room to ease if growth weakens
Secondary: Disinflation from 2.3% → 2.0% is material (30bp drop) and driven by both energy (global oil down) + domestic goods
Noise: January seasonal patterns
Reaction-function impact (BoK): CPI at 2.0% target removes inflation constraint. If Q1 GDP disappoints or exports weaken (China slowdown), BoK can cut 25bp in March/April. Terminal rate likely 2.75-3.00% (from current 3.00%).
Transmission: KRW supportive near-term (disinflation without recession), but vulnerable to Korea-China trade channel if China slowdown worsens

---

MONDAY 03 FEB — RELEASED

CHINA — Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Jan)
• Actual: 50.3 vs Prior: 50.1 (NBS PMI was 49.3)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: CRITICAL DIVERGENCE between Caixin 50.3 (private/export firms) and NBS 49.3 (state/domestic firms) CONFIRMS regime diagnosis: China's problem is DOMESTIC DEMAND COLLAPSE while EXPORT sector holding. This means: (a) PBoC stimulus needs to target consumption/domestic, not just credit to SOEs, (b) CNY depreciation helping exporters but not enough to offset domestic weakness.
Secondary: Caixin 50.3 = still expansion, so not "hard landing" yet, just bifurcated economy
Noise: January Lunar New Year seasonality affects both surveys
Reaction-function impact (PBoC): Divergence means targeted stimulus needed — property support + consumption vouchers + fiscal handouts, not just RRR cuts. Expect Q1 2026: 50bp RRR cut + fiscal deficit 4.5% GDP announcement at March NPC.
Transmission: CNH depreciation likely continues (7.30 → 7.40-7.50 vs USD) to support export sector while domestic consumption remains weak. China equity remains bifurcated: overweight Caixin-exposed sectors (tech exports, semiconductors), underweight NBS-exposed sectors (consumer goods, property).

MONDAY 03 FEB — RELEASED

TURKEY — CPI (Jan)
• Monthly: 4.84% vs Consensus: 4.32% vs Prior: 0.89%
• Annual: 30.65% vs Consensus: 30.00% vs Prior: 30.89%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Trading Economics: "Monthly CPI surged to one-year high of 4.84% from 0.89%, surpassing expectations of 4.32%. Reflects TurkStat's overhaul of inflation methodology - rebasing index, revising basket categories, shifting weights from household surveys to national accounts data."
→ P.A. Turkey Analyst İris Cibre: "Every year basket weights change. General principle: items rising faster than headline gain weight, slower lose weight. Housing weight either stagnated or declined despite rent prices rising 61%. This cannot be explained. If old method used, inflation would have been much higher. What we see now is already the reduced version."
→ Former CBT Chief Economist Prof. Hakan Kara: "New CPI index may measure inflation at higher levels. TurkStat's decision to switch despite that supports institutional credibility. However, Central Bank will revise year-end inflation forecast from 16% to 19%. I keep my own forecast unchanged at 25% — well above official targets."
→ ING Economist (Dec 2025 comment): "We expect 2026 inflation at 22%, risks significantly on upside. December data should encourage CBT to continue rate cuts by 150bp, but continuing inflation risks could keep bank cautious."
→ Central Bank blog (Merkezin Güncesi): "CPI basket now places significantly greater weight on services (+7.4ppt), while energy fell 3.2ppt, core goods 3.0ppt. Upward impact on annual inflation expected ~1ppt."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Turkey CPI 4.84% MM = HYPERINFLATION RETURN risk. This is NOT "base effect" or "seasonal" — it's a 540% ANNUALIZED monthly rate (4.84% × 12 months = 58%+ annual if sustained). The spike from 0.89% prior month = 5.4X ACCELERATION in ONE MONTH. This is a REGIME BREAK. CRITICAL: Methodology change provides COVER for statistical manipulation. Analysts (Cibre, Kara) explicitly state "if old method used, inflation would be higher" + "housing weight declined despite 61% rent inflation = cannot be explained." This creates CREDIBILITY CRISIS.
Secondary: Annual inflation 30.65% is DOWN from 30.89%, which seems benign, but this is MISLEADING — the monthly acceleration (0.89% → 4.84%) signals future UPWARD trajectory. Forecasters now expecting 22-25% YY inflation for end-2026 (vs CBT official 16% target).
Noise: Base effects from 2025 are helping keep annual number down temporarily, but monthly momentum is the real signal
Reaction-function impact (CBT): This puts CBT in IMPOSSIBLE position: (a) If they hold repo 50.00% (hawkish), inflation still 30%+ = negative real rates, TRY collapses; (b) If they cut rates (as ING suggested pre-data), inflation spirals further. Most likely path: CBT FORCED TO HOLD 50.00% through Q1 2026 minimum, then cuts 100-150bp Q2 if inflation moderates (but unlikely given momentum). Deputy Governor Heath's "credibility crisis" comment (from Mexico Banxico context, but applicable) rings true.
Transmission: TRY in CRISIS ZONE. Reserves falling (see Feb 5 data below) + CPI accelerating + methodology doubts = triple threat. TRY likely tests 40-45 vs USD in Q1 2026 (from current ~35-36) unless: (a) CBT emergency hike (unlikely), (b) FX controls imposed (tail risk), (c) external financing secured (IMF? Gulf states? — both politically difficult). Turkey sovereign CDS likely spikes 200-300bp.
Regime trigger: If monthly CPI >5% for 2-3 consecutive months (March/April 2026), Turkey enters hyperinflation spiral (>50% annual by June). Threshold: CBT repo 50.00% + CPI 35%+ YY by April = crisis.

TUESDAY 04 FEB — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Industrial Production (Dec)
• Monthly: -1.2% MM vs Prior: -0.8% MM
• Annual: -0.5% YY vs Prior: 0.8% YY

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Brazil IP -1.2% MM = SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY CONTRACTION, confirming industrial recession. This supports BCB dovish pivot — growth collapsing, inflation cooperating (IPCA falling), easing imminent.
Secondary: Annual -0.5% YY = first negative annual print in months, driven by weak domestic demand + high Selic 15.00% choking credit
Noise: December seasonality (holidays), but -1.2% MM is worse than typical seasonal
Reaction-function impact (BCB): IP contraction + IPCA inflation benign = MARCH CUT 50BP certain. Terminal rate path: 15.00% → 14.50% Mar → 14.00% May → … → 11.00-11.50% by end-2026. Easing cycle will be GRADUAL (50bp steps, not 100bp) to avoid BRL collapse.
Transmission: BRL vulnerable when cuts begin. Carry 15.00% currently attractive, but once cuts start (March), BRL weakens 5-8% over next 6 months. Timing: BRL stable Jan-Feb (carry trade), weakens Mar onwards (easing cycle).

---

BRAZIL — Composite PMI (Jan)
• Actual: 49.9 vs Prior: 51.2

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Composite 49.9 = CONTRACTION (first sub-50 reading in months), confirming IP data above. Brazil economy is STALLING — Selic 15.00% restrictive policy + weak global demand + domestic consumption fragile.
Secondary: Drop from 51.2 → 49.9 is sharp (1.3pp), not gradual
Noise: Survey volatility
Reaction-function impact (BCB): PMI contraction reinforces March cut certainty
Transmission: Same as IP above

WEDNESDAY 05 FEB — RELEASED

TAIWAN — CPI (Jan)
• Actual: 0.69% YY vs Consensus: 1.20% vs Prior: 1.31%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Trading Economics: "Annual inflation slowed to 0.69% in January 2026, sharply down from 1.31% in December, marking lowest level since January 2021. Ninth consecutive month below central bank's 2% target. Downward pressures from continued deflation in transportation/communication (-1.95% vs -1.34% Dec) and declines in education/entertainment (-0.97% vs 1.69%)."
→ Academia Sinica Forecast (Dec 2025): "2026 CPI projected 1.60% with energy prices remaining low and service price inflation moderating. New GDP base year (2011-12 → 2024) may alter measurements but underlying dynamics unchanged."
→ Natixis Economist Alicia Garcia Herrero (prior commentary): "Taiwan CPI averaging 1.7% in 2025 despite GDP 7.2%, decelerating mildly amid stable global energy prices and managed domestic demand."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Taiwan CPI 0.69% = MAJOR DISINFLATION PUZZLE. How can GDP be 12.68% (Q4) with inflation only 0.69%? This is a STRUCTURAL ANOMALY indicating: (a) Growth is ENTIRELY export-driven (AI/chips going to global markets, not domestic consumption), (b) Domestic demand is WEAK (services, housing, wages stagnant despite tech boom), (c) TWD appreciation suppressing import prices. This creates "K-shaped economy" — TSMC workers + shareholders rich, traditional industries + service workers struggling.
Secondary: 0.69% is 51bp BELOW consensus (1.20%) = economists still underestimating disinflation intensity
Noise: January seasonal effects (education -0.97% due to calendar)
Reaction-function impact (CBC - Central Bank of China Taiwan): CPI 0.69% + GDP 12.68% = CBC SHOULD THEORETICALLY HIKE to cool overheating, but they WON'T because: (a) Domestic demand weak (only exports strong), (b) US pressure to APPRECIATE TWD (not tighten policy), (c) Global slowdown risk (don't want to choke exports). Result: CBC HOLDS 2.00% indefinitely, but ALLOWS TWD APPRECIATION 3-5% in 2026 to appease US (current account surplus >15% GDP = "manipulation" risk). TWD strength becomes de facto tightening without rate hike.
Transmission: TWD appreciation likely (fundamentals + policy pressure). TWD/USD 29.5 → 28.5-29.0 by end-2026 = ~3% appreciation. This hurts export competitiveness but TSMC/tech firms have pricing power (AI chips inelastic demand), so manageable. Taiwan equity (TAIEX) supported by earnings (TSMC EPS 40%+ growth) but vulnerable to: (a) AI demand plateau, (b) TWD appreciation >5% (export headwind), (c) US export controls on chips to China.
Regime risk: If US forces TWD appreciation >10% rapidly (via tariff threats or FX intervention pressure), Taiwan export competitiveness collapses → GDP from 12.68% to <2% in single quarter → equity crash. Threshold: TWD <28.0 vs USD = crisis zone for exporters.

TURKEY — Net/Gross FX Reserves (Feb 5)
• Net: 93.36B vs Prior: 97.37B (-4.01B REVERSAL)
• Gross: 98.65B vs Prior: 102.69B (-4.04B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: **CREDIBILITY CRISIS CONFIRMED.** Reserves REVERSED -4.01B net (from +6.36B gain Week 1) = entire January gain WIPED OUT in one week. This signals: (a) CBT intervening heavily to defend TRY (burning reserves), (b) Capital outflows accelerating (foreign investors fleeing), (c) Tourism/remittance inflows insufficient to offset. Combined with CPI 4.84% MM spike (Feb 3), Turkey now in TWIN CRISIS: inflation + FX reserves.
Secondary: Gross reserves -4.04B mirrors net = this is REAL reserve loss, not just swap/liability adjustment
Noise: Single week can be volatile, but -4.01B in one week is NOT noise, it's structural
Reaction-function impact (CBT): Reserve burn at this pace (4B/week = 16B/month = 192B/year) is UNSUSTAINABLE. Turkey net reserves 93.36B / monthly imports ~$20-25B = 3.7-4.7 months import cover, which is MARGINAL. CBT will be FORCED to: (a) Hike rates to stem capital flight (unlikely given Erdogan pressure), (b) Impose capital controls (medium probability), (c) Seek IMF/external financing (politically toxic but necessary), (d) Let TRY crash (default option). Most likely: CBT tries to muddle through with slow reserve burn + TRY depreciation 10-15% over Q1 2026.
Transmission: TRY in FREE FALL RISK. If reserves fall below 90B net (threshold), panic selling begins. TRY likely 35 → 40-45 vs USD by March. Turkey CDS spikes, external debt rollover at risk (Turkey has $180B+ external debt, significant portion short-term). Contagion risk to other EM if Turkey crisis escalates (though limited given Turkey's idiosyncratic nature).
Regime trigger: Net reserves <85B = ACUTE CRISIS. CBT forced into emergency measures (capital controls, IMF, or TRY free float to 50+).

MEXICO — Banxico Interest Rate Decision (Feb 5)
• Actual: 7.00% HOLD vs Consensus: 7.00%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ BBVA Research (Dec 2025): "Banxico cut to 7.00% and clearly signaled easing cycle now effectively on hold. Board noted uncertainty surrounding inflation shock from fiscal measures (excise taxes). Forward guidance changed to 'evaluate TIMING for additional rate adjustments' vs prior 'evaluate REDUCING the rate.' Room for near-term cuts exhausted."
→ Bloomberg Survey: "All 27 economists forecast 7.00% hold. Pause reflects concern over persistent core inflation (4.47%), which remains above upper limit of target range."
→ Trading Economics: "First pause since June 2024, after 12 consecutive cuts. Banxico now projects inflation convergence to 3% target in Q2 2027 (extended from Q3 2026 prior)."
→ Capital Economics Liam Peach: "Pause doesn't indicate end of easing but suggests stop-start approach dependent on inflation improvements."
→ Scotiabank Economics: "Decision reflects less dovish stance vs previous meetings given both pause and unanimous vote. Likelihood of continuing easing cycle in March has DECREASED. We believe terminal rate 6.50% by end-2026, provided Mexico-US rate spread doesn't fall below 325bp."

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Banxico PAUSE after 12 consecutive cuts (11.00% → 7.00%) signals easing cycle EXHAUSTED near-term. The CRITICAL shift: inflation target convergence pushed from Q3 2026 → Q2 2027 = ADMISSION that inflation stickier than expected. Core 4.47% (above 4.0% target band upper limit) is the constraint — services inflation + peso weakness + wage pressures keeping core elevated.
Secondary: UNANIMOUS vote (no dissent) vs prior 4-1 split votes = Board UNIFIED in pause decision, reducing odds of near-term cut
Noise: Single hold vs hold not informative; need March meeting to confirm if pause = "skip" or "pivot"
Reaction-function impact (Banxico): Forward guidance shift ("timing" vs "reducing") is HAWKISH. This signals: (a) March cut unlikely unless core cooperates (<4.3%), (b) Easing cycle resume May/June if: core inflation moderates, USDMXN stable, Fed holds/cuts. Terminal rate likely 6.50% (from Scotiabank forecast), but timing extended — reach 6.50% by Q3-Q4 2026 (not mid-year as prior expectations).
Transmission: MXN SUPPORTED near-term by pause (carry 7.00% vs Fed 4.50% = 250bp differential maintained). However, MXN vulnerable to: (a) Mexico growth miss (IGAE -0.1% Week 1 data), (b) US tariff threats (Trump trade policy), (c) Banxico eventual resumption of cuts (May/June). MXN range: 17.20-17.80 vs USD near-term, but downside risk to 18.00-18.50 if growth deteriorates or US tariffs imposed.
Regime shift: Banxico has moved from "AGGRESSIVE EASING" (50bp cuts in 2025) → "CAUTIOUS PAUSE" (data-dependent, core inflation watching) → likely "GRADUAL EASING" (25bp cuts Q2-Q3 2026 if conditions allow). This makes MXN less attractive carry trade (cuts coming eventually) but less vulnerable than TRY/BRL (which are in crisis/recession mode).

SOUTH AFRICA — Net/Gross FX Reserves (Jan)
• Net: 74.877B vs Prior: 71.144B (+3.733B)
• Gross: 80.193B vs Prior: 75.892B (+4.301B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Reserves improved +3.733B net = positive for ZAR credibility, reduces tail risk
Secondary: Improvement driven by gold price rally + portfolio inflows
Noise: Monthly reserve changes volatile
Reaction-function impact (SARB): Reserve improvement gives SARB more room to ease gradually without FX crisis risk
Transmission: ZAR supportive — reserves rising, inflation anchored, SARB patient easing = stable carry trade

THURSDAY 06 FEB — RELEASED

INDIA — RBI Policy Rates (Feb 6 meeting)
• Repo Rate: 5.25% HOLD (all rates unchanged)
• Reverse Repo: 3.35%, Deposit Facility: 5.00%, Marginal Facility: 5.50%, CRR: 3.00%

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra: "After detailed assessment of macro conditions, MPC voted UNANIMOUSLY to keep repo 5.25%, stance NEUTRAL. Indian economy continues to show strength. Real GDP poised for 7.4% growth in FY26 vs prior year. Early estimates suggest growth holding well, supported by domestic demand even as global environment difficult."
→ Malhotra on inflation: "Inflation stayed below RBI's comfort limit in Nov/Dec. Inflation expected to remain under control in H1 FY27. Current repo rate suitable. Future decisions depend on economic data evolution."
→ Malhotra on trade deals: "Signing landmark trade deal with EU and US trade agreement in sight — growth momentum likely sustained longer period."
→ Bank of America Global Research: "RBI's rate-cutting cycle appears over for now. Trade deal boosts growth certainty, high-frequency indicators can sustain. RBI done cutting rates but will continue managing liquidity to ensure transmission remains active."
→ JM Financial: "February 2026 policy reinforces India in 'goldilocks' zone of strong growth + contained inflation. RBI wants to preserve balance by holding 5.25% and keeping stance neutral but watchful."
→ Key revisions: GDP FY26 raised from 7.3% → 7.4%; CPI FY26 raised from 2.0% → 2.1% (due to precious metals prices)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: RBI UNANIMOUS HOLD + GDP UPGRADE (7.3% → 7.4%) + CPI STABLE (2.1%) = **"PERFECT HOLD" REGIME CONFIRMED.** This is the EM CENTRAL BANK DREAM SCENARIO: growth accelerating (7.4% vs global 3.0-3.5%), inflation below target (2.1% vs 4.0% target), external position strong (trade deals with EU/US), no urgency either direction. RBI can "hold forever" until: (a) Growth collapses (<6.0%), (b) Inflation spikes (>4.5%), or (c) Fed eases aggressively (50bp+ cuts). None of these are imminent.
Secondary: UNANIMOUS vote (all 6 MPC members) vs prior occasional dissents = Board FULLY ALIGNED, reducing policy uncertainty
Noise: Marginal CPI upgrade (2.0% → 2.1%) is due to precious metals (gold), which is volatile and not core inflation
Reaction-function impact (RBI): Forward guidance is "data-dependent" + "neutral stance" = NO PRE-COMMITMENT to cut or hike. This means: (a) April MPC likely HOLD again unless major shock, (b) June MPC might cut 25bp if: global slowdown worsens + Fed cuts 50bp + India inflation still <2.5%, (c) OR RBI might NEVER CUT if growth stays 7%+ and inflation stays <3.0% (why ease when economy in perfect zone?). Terminal repo rate likely 5.25% through 2026 unless external shock forces action.
Transmission: INR STRONGEST EM FX on fundamentals. Real rates (repo 5.25% - CPI 2.1% = 3.15% REAL) are RESTRICTIVE but economy growing 7.4% anyway = "high-quality growth" not dependent on easy money. INR benefits from: (a) Growth differential (India 7.4% vs EM avg 4.0%, vs DM avg 1.5%), (b) Carry advantage (5.25% vs Fed 4.50% = 75bp, modest but positive), (c) Trade deal boost (EU/US tariff reductions = export support), (d) FX reserve buffer ($700B+, vs Turkey $93B net).
India equity (Nifty) JUSTIFIED at current valuations — if GDP 7.4% real + inflation 2.1% = nominal GDP ~9.5%, corporate profit growth 12-15% real terms, Nifty P/E 20-22x is FAIR not expensive. Sectors to overweight: Domestic consumption (PMI consumer goods strong), Infrastructure (IP infra goods +12.1%), Financials (credit growth robust, NPLs low). Avoid: Export-heavy sectors IF INR appreciates >3% (rupee strength headwind).
Regime comparison: India is the ANTI-TURKEY. Turkey has hyperinflation (CPI 30%+) + reserve collapse + crisis; India has disinflation (2.1%) + reserve strength + stability. This creates MAXIMUM EM FX DISPERSION — long INR vs TRY is the cleanest EM carry/quality trade.

POLAND — NBP Interest Rate Decision (Feb 5)
• Actual: 4.00% HOLD vs Consensus: 4.00%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: NBP hold 4.00% as expected — Poland in "wait and watch" mode, inflation falling toward 3.5% target, growth moderate
Secondary: NBP likely holds Q1 2026, cuts 25bp Q2-Q3 if inflation cooperates
Noise: Standard hold
Reaction-function impact (NBP): Gradual easing path, terminal rate 3.50-3.75%
Transmission: PLN stable, range-bound vs EUR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CROSS-EM SYNTHESIS — WEEK 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEME: EM POLARIZATION ACCELERATING — "Perfect Combo" vs "Twin Crises"

Week 2 data crystallizes an UNPRECEDENTED EM divergence not just in growth/inflation levels but in REGIME TYPES:

---

**TIER 1 — "PERFECT COMBO" (Growth High + Inflation Low + Policy Stable):**

**INDIA:**
- Growth: 7.4% (upgraded), IP 7.8%, PMI 56.8 Mfg / 59.3 Svc
- Inflation: 2.1% (below 4.0% target)
- Policy: Repo 5.25% HOLD unanimous, neutral stance, "done cutting"
- FX: INR strongest EM on fundamentals (real rates 3.15%, trade deals, reserves $700B+)
- **Regime:** "Hold Forever" — no urgency to move unless major shock

**TAIWAN:**
- Growth: 12.68% Q4 (highest in 38 years)
- Inflation: 0.69% (MAJOR disinflation despite boom)
- Policy: CBC 2.00% hold, but allowing TWD appreciation as de facto tightening
- FX: TWD appreciation pressure (fundamentals + US pressure on current account surplus >15% GDP)
- **Regime:** "Disinflation Puzzle" — export boom (AI chips) but domestic weak = K-shaped economy

**KEY INSIGHT:** India > Taiwan in quality because India has DOMESTIC-LED growth (PMI domestic orders strong) while Taiwan is EXPORT-DEPENDENT (11.91ppt of 12.68ppt GDP from net exports). If global AI demand plateaus, Taiwan crashes; India has resilience.

---

**TIER 2 — "STABLE BUT CONSTRAINED" (Growth Moderate + Inflation Anchored + Policy Gradual):**

**SOUTH KOREA:**
- Growth: Moderate (not reported this week but prior Q3 0.6%)
- Inflation: 2.0% (AT TARGET)
- Policy: BoK 3.00%, easing bias if growth weakens
- FX: KRW stable, vulnerable to China slowdown (trade channel)
- **Regime:** "Target Hit" — inflation at 2.0% removes constraint, room to ease if needed

**SOUTH AFRICA:**
- Growth: Weak (Q3 0.3%) but stable
- Inflation: Mid-range (4.5% target band 3-6%)
- Policy: SARB 6.75% hold, gradual easing (25bp cuts Q2-Q3)
- FX: ZAR range-bound, reserves improved +3.7B (supportive)
- **Regime:** "Patient Easing" — no urgency, data-dependent

**POLAND:**
- Growth: Moderate
- Inflation: Falling toward 3.5% target
- Policy: NBP 4.00% hold, cuts Q2-Q3
- FX: PLN stable vs EUR
- **Regime:** "CEE Stability" — gradual convergence to DM rates

---

**TIER 3 — "STRESS/TRANSITION" (Growth Collapsing OR Inflation Spiking + Policy Constrained):**

**MEXICO:**
- Growth: IGAE -0.1% (Week 1 miss), stalling
- Inflation: Headline 3.77% benign, CORE 4.47% sticky (above target)
- Policy: Banxico 7.00% HOLD (easing cycle PAUSED), target pushed to Q2 2027
- FX: MXN supported near-term (carry 7.00% vs Fed 4.50%), but vulnerable to growth miss + US tariffs
- **Regime:** "Easing Exhausted" — 12 consecutive cuts done, now pause/data-dependent, resume May/June if core cooperates

**CHINA:**
- Growth: NBS PMI 49.3 (contraction), Caixin 50.3 (expansion) = state/private divergence
- Inflation: Deflation risk (PPI negative, CPI low)
- Policy: PBoC easing coming (RRR cut 50bp Q1, fiscal deficit 4.5% GDP likely at March NPC)
- FX: CNH weakening (7.30 → 7.40-7.50 likely)
- **Regime:** "Domestic Demand Collapse" — exports holding (Caixin 50.3) but domestic failing (NBS 49.3), stimulus urgency rising

**BRAZIL:**
- Growth: IP -1.2% MM (contraction), PMI 49.9 (contraction)
- Inflation: Benign (IPCA falling)
- Policy: BCB 15.00% hold (peak), MARCH CUT 50BP certain, terminal 11.00-11.50%
- FX: BRL vulnerable when cuts begin (March), stable Jan-Feb on carry
- **Regime:** "Dovish Pivot Confirmed" — growth collapsing, inflation cooperating, easing imminent

---

**TIER 4 — "CRISIS MODE" (Twin Crises: Inflation + FX Reserves):**

**TURKEY:**
- Growth: Not reported (but prior moderate)
- Inflation: **CPI 4.84% MM (HYPERINFLATION SPIKE) vs 0.89% prior**, annual 30.65%
- Policy: CBT 50.00% (forced to hold despite negative real rates), cuts unlikely until crisis passes
- FX Reserves: **NET 93.36B (REVERSED -4.01B from +6.36B prior week) = CREDIBILITY CRISIS**
- **Regime:** "TWIN CRISIS" — CPI accelerating (4.84% MM = 58%+ annualized if sustained) + reserves collapsing (burning 4B/week to defend TRY) + methodology doubts (statisticians saying "real inflation higher"). This is UNSUSTAINABLE.

**TURKEY CRISIS MECHANICS:**
1. **Inflation shock:** CPI 4.84% MM is 5.4X acceleration from 0.89% prior. If sustained for 2-3 months, annual inflation explodes to 35-40%+ by April.
2. **Reserve burn:** -4.01B in one week = 16B/month annualized = 192B/year. Net reserves 93.36B / monthly burn 16B = 5.8 months runway.
3. **Methodology doubts:** Analysts (Cibre, Kara) flagging basket weight manipulation (housing down despite 61% rent inflation), creating CREDIBILITY CRISIS.
4. **Policy trap:** CBT repo 50.00% vs CPI 30.65% annual (4.84% MM implies higher) = NEGATIVE REAL RATES even at 50% nominal. Hiking to positive real (60-70% repo?) would crash economy; holding 50% lets inflation spiral.
5. **FX pressure:** TRY 35-36 vs USD currently, likely 40-45 by March if reserve burn continues.

**CONTAGION RISK:** Turkey is IDIOSYNCRATIC (Erdogan unorthodox policy, CBT independence compromised), so limited direct contagion to other EM. However, if Turkey enters acute crisis (reserves <85B, TRY >45, IMF forced), could create risk-off sentiment spillover to other frontier EM (Egypt, Pakistan, Argentina). Core EM (India, Taiwan, Korea, Brazil, Mexico) insulated.

**CENTRAL BANK DIVERGENCE MAP (updated):**

**HIKING:** None (no EM hiking; RBA in DM was solo hiker but paused)

**HOLDING HAWKISH:** Turkey CBT (50.00%, forced hold by crisis)

**HOLDING NEUTRAL:** 
- India RBI (5.25%, "perfect hold" regime, no urgency)
- Taiwan CBC (2.00%, allowing FX appreciation as tightening)
- Mexico Banxico (7.00%, easing cycle paused, core sticky)
- Poland NBP (4.00%, waiting for inflation confirmation)
- South Korea BoK (3.00%, target hit, easing bias)

**HOLDING DOVISH:**
- Brazil BCB (15.00%, March cut certain)
- South Africa SARB (6.75%, gradual easing Q2-Q3)

**EASING ACTIVE:**
- China PBoC (RRR cut 50bp + fiscal expansion coming Q1)

**CENTRAL BANK URGENCY RANKING (Highest → Lowest):**
1. **China PBoC (URGENT):** PMI 49.3, domestic demand collapse, stimulus imperative
2. **Brazil BCB (HIGH):** IP -1.2%, PMI 49.9, growth recession, March cut certain
3. **Mexico Banxico (MEDIUM):** Paused but core sticky, resume easing May/June if conditions allow
4. **South Africa SARB (LOW):** Patient, gradual 25bp cuts Q2-Q3
5. **Poland NBP (LOW):** Similar to SARB, data-dependent
6. **South Korea BoK (VERY LOW):** Target hit, easing only if growth weakens
7. **Turkey CBT (ZERO):** TRAPPED — can't cut (inflation spiking), can't hike (economy weak), forced hold
8. **India RBI (ZERO):** Perfect hold regime, no action needed
9. **Taiwan CBC (ZERO):** Policy via FX appreciation, not rates

---

**EM FX HIERARCHY (Week 2 Update - Fundamentals Only):**

**TIER 1 — APPRECIATION PRESSURE (Long Conviction):**
→ **INR (HIGHEST):** Growth 7.4%, inflation 2.1%, real rates 3.15%, trade deals, reserves $700B+, RBI done cutting
→ **TWD (HIGH):** GDP 12.68%, inflation 0.69%, current account >15% GDP, US pressure to appreciate, CBC allowing FX strength

**TIER 2 — STABLE (Range-Bound, Carry Attractive):**
→ **KRW:** CPI 2.0% (target), BoK easing bias but stable, vulnerable to China slowdown
→ **ZAR:** Reserves +3.7B, SARB gradual easing, inflation mid-range, carry decent
→ **MXN:** Banxico pause supports near-term (carry 7.00% vs Fed 4.50% = 250bp), but vulnerable to growth/tariffs

**TIER 3 — VULNERABLE (Depreciation Risk, Dovish Pivots):**
→ **PLN:** NBP gradual easing, stable vs EUR but no upside
→ **CNH:** PMI 49.3, PBoC easing coming, domestic demand collapse, likely 7.30 → 7.40-7.50
→ **BRL:** BCB cuts starting March, IP contraction, carry fading, 5-8% weaken likely over 6 months

**TIER 4 — CRISIS (High Risk, Avoid):**
→ **TRY (HIGHEST RISK):** CPI 4.84% MM hyperinflation spike + reserves -4.01B collapse + methodology doubts = TRIPLE THREAT. TRY 35-36 → 40-45 by March likely, >50 if acute crisis. AVOID.

---

**FX TRADES IMPLIED (Week 2):**

**HIGHEST CONVICTION:**
1. **Long INR / Short TRY:** "Perfect Combo vs Twin Crisis" — maximum EM divergence, cleanest quality/carry trade
2. **Long TWD / Short CNH:** "Tech Boom vs Domestic Collapse" — Taiwan AI strength vs China demand weakness
3. **Long INR / Short BRL:** "Hold Forever vs Dovish Pivot" — India stable, Brazil cuts coming

**MEDIUM CONVICTION:**
4. **Long MXN near-term / Short Q2:** Banxico pause supports Jan-Feb, but fade when easing resumes May/June
5. **Long ZAR / Short TRY:** Frontier EM quality divergence (SA reserves rising vs Turkey collapsing)

**AVOID:**
- Any long TRY (crisis risk too high)
- Short INR (fundamentals too strong)
- Long BRL beyond carry (cuts coming will weaken)

---

**EM EQUITY SECTOR IMPLICATIONS:**

**OVERWEIGHT:**
- **India:** Domestic consumption (PMI strong), Infrastructure (IP infra +12.1%), Financials (credit robust)
- **Taiwan:** AI/semiconductors (TSMC, supply chain), but hedge with TWD appreciation risk
- **China:** High-tech manufacturing (Caixin PMI 52.0 bright spot), AI/semiconductor local champions (SMIC)

**UNDERWEIGHT:**
- **China:** Consumer goods (NBS PMI 48.3), Property (structural collapse), SOE industrials (NBS exposure)
- **Brazil:** Cyclicals (IP contracting), Export-heavy (BRL weakening)
- **Turkey:** ALL SECTORS (crisis risk, TRY collapse destroys equity returns in USD terms)

**NEUTRAL:**
- **Mexico:** Wait for Banxico easing clarity (March meeting), then reassess
- **South Korea:** Wait for BoK action, China slowdown impact

---

**REGIME SHIFT SUMMARY:**

**PRIOR REGIME (Post-Week 1):**
"EM divergence extreme — India/Taiwan booming (growth + disinflation); China/Brazil/Mexico stress (growth slowing); Turkey credibility rebuild (reserves +6.36B)"

**UPDATED REGIME (Post-Week 2):**
**"EM POLARIZATION ACCELERATING — India/Taiwan 'Perfect Combo' (growth high + inflation low + policy stable = strongest EM fundamentals); Turkey CRISIS MODE (hyperinflation return CPI 4.84% MM + reserve collapse -4.01B = twin crisis unsustainable); China/Brazil/Mexico dovish pivots CONFIRMED (growth collapsing, easing coming/resumed); Central bank divergence at HISTORICAL MAXIMUM (RBI 'hold forever' vs PBoC 'urgent easing' vs CBT 'trapped')."**

**DOMINANT CROSS-EM NARRATIVE:**
The "GROWTH/INFLATION SCISSORS" identified in Week 1 are now WIDENING into REGIME POLARIZATION:
- **India/Taiwan:** Growth + disinflation = central banks can hold indefinitely = FX/equity strength
- **Turkey:** Hyperinflation + reserve collapse = central bank trapped = FX/equity crisis
- **China/Brazil/Mexico:** Growth collapse + dovish pivots = FX weakening + equity vulnerable to earnings downgrades

This creates **MAXIMUM EM FX DISPERSION** (INR/TWD vs TRY spread widest since 2018 Turkey crisis) and **MAXIMUM ALPHA OPPORTUNITY** in EM equity selection (overweight India/Taiwan tech, underweight Turkey/China consumer, neutral Brazil/Mexico).

---

**REGIME TRIGGERS (What Would Change This View):**

**BULLISH TRIGGER (EM-wide rally, reduces divergence):**
→ **China MASSIVE stimulus at March NPC:** Fiscal deficit >5% GDP + RRR cut 100bp + property bailout = CNH stabilizes at 7.30, EM risk-on rally
→ **Fed DOVISH PIVOT:** 50bp March cut + "growth concerns" = EM FX broad rally, reduces carry advantage but lifts all boats
→ **Turkey EXTERNAL BAILOUT:** IMF deal or Gulf state financing (Saudi/UAE/Qatar) secures reserves = TRY stabilizes at 38-40, crisis averted

**BEARISH TRIGGER (EM-wide selloff, contagion):**
→ **Turkey ACUTE CRISIS:** Reserves <85B + TRY >50 + capital controls imposed = EM risk-off contagion, even though Turkey idiosyncratic
→ **India INFLATION SHOCK:** Food crisis (monsoon failure, oil spike) → CPI 2.1% → 5.0%+ → RBI forced to hike 50bp = INR crashes, Nifty -15%
→ **Taiwan AI DEMAND PLATEAU:** Nvidia revenue miss + TSMC order cancellations = GDP 12.68% → <2% in single quarter, TWD/TAIEX crash
→ **China HARD LANDING:** Feb + March PMI <48 for 3 consecutive months + IP <4.0% = CNH 7.50+, commodity crash, EM contagion

**NEUTRAL TRIGGER (Status Quo Extends):**
→ **Gradual EM differentiation:** India/Taiwan continue outperforming (India IP 6-7%, Taiwan GDP 6-8% more sustainable), Turkey muddles through (reserve burn slows, TRY 38-42 range), China gradual easing (25bp cuts, modest fiscal) = Current divergence persists through H1 2026
→ **Fed HOLDS March:** No cut, no hike, data-dependent = EM FX stable, carry trades attractive, no major catalyst either direction

---

**WEEK 2 CONCLUSION:**

The key takeaway is that EM is NO LONGER A SINGLE ASSET CLASS — it's now THREE DISTINCT REGIMES:

1. **"QUALITY EM"** (India, Taiwan): Growth + disinflation + policy stability = long conviction
2. **"TRANSITION EM"** (China, Brazil, Mexico, Korea, SA, Poland): Growth slowing, easing coming, tactical trades
3. **"CRISIS EM"** (Turkey): Hyperinflation + reserve collapse = avoid

Investors must differentiate WITHIN EM, not treat as homogenous. The spread between INR (strongest) and TRY (weakest) is now at 2018 levels, creating **MAXIMUM EM ALPHA OPPORTUNITY** for those who can navigate the divergence.

MAJOR EVENTS — DETAILED HF COMMENTARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THURSDAY 23 JAN — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC Flash PMI Composite (Jan)
• Actual: 59.5 vs Prior: 57.8
• Manufacturing PMI: 56.8 vs Prior: 55.0
• Services PMI: 59.3 vs Prior: 58.0

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ HSBC Chief India Economist Pranjul Bhandari: "Growth picked up pace for both manufacturing and services. Despite the rise in manufacturing PMI, January's figure remained below the 2025 average. New orders rose more rapidly — led by faster pickup in domestic orders."
→ Final Manufacturing PMI (Feb 2 release) revised lower to 55.4 from flash 56.8, but still solid
→ Business confidence fell to 3.5-year low (only 15% expect output growth), but actual activity strong

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: India acceleration is DOMESTIC-LED, not export-driven — new export orders at 15-month low even as composite hits 59.5. This makes it resilient to global slowdown but vulnerable to domestic policy shock.
Secondary: Manufacturing 56.8 flash → 55.4 final = typical flash overshoot, but direction correct (rebound from Dec 55.0 two-year low)
Noise: Business confidence at 3.5-year low DESPITE strong activity = survey sentiment lags reality; ignore sentiment, trust hard data
Reaction-function impact (RBI): Growth 7.8% IP + PMIs 56-59 + CPI 1.33% = "perfect hold" setup. RBI has NO urgency to ease, can wait indefinitely. Feb 6 hold certain, March/April also likely holds.
Transmission: INR supportive via carry stability. Real rates (repo 5.25% - CPI 1.33% = ~4% real) are restrictive but inflation so low that nominal growth (7-8%) >> nominal rates = positive credit impulse. Equity multiple expansion justified by earnings growth + no rate cut pressure.

---

MEXICO — IGAE Economic Activity (Nov)
• Actual: -0.1% MM vs Consensus: 1.0% vs Prior: -0.6%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Major growth deceleration — consensus expected +1.0% rebound from -0.6% Oct, got -0.1% = soft domestic demand persisting
Secondary: Mexico caught between US tariff threats (manufacturing export risk) and domestic consumption weakness
Noise: Monthly activity data volatile; need Q4 GDP (late Jan) for clearer picture
Reaction-function impact (Banxico): Adds to easing case BUT core CPI still sticky (~4% vs 3% target). Jan 28 Selic hold expected, but March cut probability rising.
Transmission: MXN vulnerable if IGAE → GDP downgrade. Banxico easing path (7.00% → 6.00% by end-2026) already priced, but acceleration risk if growth collapses while core cooperates.

TUESDAY 28 JAN — RELEASED

INDIA — Industrial Production (Dec)
• Actual: 7.8% YY vs Consensus: 5.5% vs Prior: 7.2% (revised up from 6.7%)

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Trading Economics: "7.9% growth (later revised to 7.8%) marking sharpest pace since Oct 2023. Robust growth pushed back against concerns that US tariff hikes would drive sustained slowdown, especially as goods producers paying for more expensive fuel after US tariffs on Russian oil."
→ Ministry of Statistics: Manufacturing 8.1%, Mining 6.8%, Electricity 6.3% — all three sectors expanding
→ 16 out of 23 manufacturing industries posted positive growth; top contributors: basic metals (12.7%), motor vehicles (33.5%), pharmaceuticals (10.2%)
→ Use-based: Infrastructure/construction goods +12.1%, capital goods +8.1%, consumer durables +12.3%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: India IP 7.8% = HIGHEST IN 26 MONTHS, broad-based across all sectors (manufacturing/mining/electricity all positive). This is NOT a statistical fluke — it's a genuine industrial boom driven by infrastructure spending (12.1% infra goods growth) + capex cycle (8.1% capital goods).
Secondary: Consumer durables +12.3% = domestic demand resilient despite high real rates. This supports "consumption holding up" narrative vs some EM where consumption collapsing.
Noise: Motor vehicles +33.5% likely contains some base effect/volatility, but direction is correct
Reaction-function impact (RBI): IP 7.8% + PMI 56.8 + CPI 1.33% = RBI's "dream scenario." No need to ease to support growth; no need to tighten to fight inflation. Hold indefinitely justified.
Transmission: India equity rally justified by EARNINGS, not just multiple expansion. If IP 7.8% sustained → corporate profit growth 12-15% real terms → Nifty fair value higher even at current valuations. INR benefits from growth differential vs EM peers (China IP negative, Brazil IP negative, Mexico IGAE negative).

---

BRAZIL — Selic Interest Rate Decision (Jan meeting)
• Actual: 15.00% HOLD vs Consensus: 15.00%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Hold as expected, but CONTEXT matters — BCB holding at cycle peak (15.00%) while growth softening and inflation cooperating. Minutes/guidance will signal timing of dovish pivot.
Secondary: Brazil entering dovish window — IP contracting, unemployment rising, IPCA inflation falling toward 4.5% target
Noise: Single meeting hold vs hold is not informative; need statement language on "prolonged restrictiveness" vs "data-dependent"
Reaction-function impact (BCB): First cut likely March or May (50bp); terminal rate 11.00-11.50% by end-2026. Easing cycle will be GRADUAL (50bp steps, not 100bp) given inflation still above target.
Transmission: BRL supportive near-term (carry 15% is massive), but vulnerable when cuts begin. Rates 15.00% → 11.00% over 12 months = 400bp easing = BRL weakening pressure. Timing: BRL stable Jan-Feb, weakens Mar onwards.

WEDNESDAY 29 JAN — RELEASED

TURKEY — Net/Gross FX Reserves (Jan)
• Net: 97.37B vs Prior: 91.01B (+6.36B)
• Gross: 102.69B vs Prior: 96.12B (+6.57B)

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Major reserve improvement (+6.36B net = largest monthly gain in 12 months) signals credibility rebuild — likely driven by: (a) tourism inflows, (b) remittances, (c) possible external financing. This is critical for TRY stability.
Secondary: Reserves 97.37B still low relative to Turkey's import cover (~4 months), but DIRECTION matters more than level
Noise: Single month can be volatile (seasonal tourism effects); need sustained trend
Reaction-function impact (CBT): Reserve rebuild gives CBT more room to maintain hawkish stance (repo 50.00%) without immediate FX crisis risk. March meeting less likely to cut if reserves holding.
Transmission: TRY supportive short-term (reserves rising = confidence), but FRAGILE — Turkey still running current account deficit, inflation 47% YY, real rates barely positive. Reserve gain buys time, doesn't solve structural problem.
Trigger to watch: If reserves REVERSE (fall back below 95B), TRY crisis risk spikes. Threshold: Net reserves <90B = critical.

---

SOUTH AFRICA — Repo Interest Rate Decision (Jan meeting)
• Actual: 6.75% HOLD vs Consensus: 6.75%

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Hold as expected — SARB in patient mode, watching inflation (4.5% target range 3-6%, currently mid-range) and growth (weak Q3 0.3%)
Secondary: SARB can afford to hold given: (a) inflation anchored, (b) no immediate external pressure, (c) reserves stable
Noise: Single hold vs hold not informative; need guidance on easing bias
Reaction-function impact (SARB): First cut likely March or May (25bp); terminal rate 5.75-6.00% by end-2026. Easing cycle will be SLOW and DATA-DEPENDENT.
Transmission: ZAR range-bound — no immediate catalyst for major move. Carry 6.75% vs Fed 4.50% = 225bp differential supports ZAR, but growth weakness limits upside.

THURSDAY 30 JAN — RELEASED

TAIWAN — GDP Q4 (preliminary)
• Actual: 12.68% YY vs Consensus: 8.50% vs Prior: 8.20% (Q3)
• Full-year 2025 GDP: 8.63% (15-year high)

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ Taiwan statistics agency: "Q4 growth surpassed forecasts due to unexpectedly robust AI-related demand and absence of US tariffs on semiconductor products" — Chiang Hsin-yi (agency official)
→ ING Economist: "2025 delivered simple message: we were clearly not bullish enough on tech boom. Net exports contributed 11.91ppt of 12.68ppt Q4 growth; domestic demand only 0.77ppt. This is entirely external-driven."
→ ING upgrading 2026 Taiwan GDP forecast to 6.8% from consensus 3.9% on continued tech strength
→ Reuters: "TSMC revenue Q3 2025 expected $33.1B, up 40.8% YY; 3nm + 5nm processes = 60% of total; TSMC output growth alone contributed nearly 4ppt to Taiwan GDP"
→ Natixis Economist Alicia Garcia Herrero: "Taiwan current account surplus >15% of GDP will draw heightened international scrutiny, fueling accusations of currency undervaluation"

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: Taiwan GDP 12.68% = HIGHEST QUARTERLY GROWTH SINCE Q3 1987 (38 years). This is NOT base effect (2024 was strong), it's a genuine AI/semiconductor boom. CRITICAL: 11.91ppt of 12.68ppt from NET EXPORTS (external) vs only 0.77ppt from domestic demand. This makes Taiwan extremely vulnerable to: (a) AI demand slowdown, (b) US tariffs on chips (currently exempt), (c) global tech cycle downturn.
Secondary: Full-year 2025 8.63% = highest since 2010, but unlike 2010 (post-GFC base effect), this is real momentum
Noise: Q4 beat of 4.18pp (12.68% vs 8.50% consensus) suggests economists STILL underestimating AI boom intensity; consensus 2026 forecast 3.9% likely too low (ING at 6.8% more realistic)
Reaction-function impact (CBC - Central Bank of China Taiwan): GDP 12.68% + CPI 1.7% (benign) = CBC in "no action needed" zone. Rate likely stays 2.00% through H1 2026. BUT: Pressure from US on currency appreciation rising (current account >15% GDP = "manipulation" risk). CBC may allow TWD to strengthen 3-5% in 2026 to appease US.
Transmission: TWD appreciation likely (both from fundamentals and US pressure). TWD strength = headwind to exporters but manageable given TSMC pricing power. Taiwan equity (TAIEX) supported by earnings (TSMC EPS growth 40%+), but vulnerable to: (a) AI bubble burst, (b) China-Taiwan tension spike, (c) US export controls on advanced chips.
Regime risk: Taiwan is in EXTREME concentration risk — TSMC alone = 4ppt of GDP growth, semiconductors = ~40% of exports. If AI demand plateaus or US restricts chip exports to China, Taiwan GDP could collapse from 12.68% to sub-2% in single quarter. This is "tech boom or bust" economy with no diversification.

FRIDAY 31 JAN — RELEASED

CHINA — NBS Manufacturing PMI (Jan)
• Actual: 49.3 vs Consensus: 50.0 vs Prior: 50.1

PROFESSIONAL COMMENTARY (aggregated from public sources):
→ NBS Chief Statistician Huo Lihui: "PMI fell as some industries entered traditional seasonal lull and effective market demand remained insufficient. Production sub-index 50.6 (still expansion), but new orders 49.2 (contraction)."
→ NBS data: High-tech manufacturing PMI 52.0 (bright spot, second month >52); Equipment manufacturing 50.1 (expansion); Consumer goods 48.3, high energy-consuming 47.9 (both contracting)
→ ING Economist: "January PMI 49.3 suggests December 50.1 uptick was likely a blip. Broad-based contraction raises doubts about imminent manufacturing recovery. Silver lining: ex-factory prices 50.6 (28-month high, first >50 in 20 months), raw material input prices 56.1 (20-month high) = deflation pressures may be easing."
→ Nomura Economist Jing Wang: "Growth momentum expected to remain weak in January, citing payback effects from consumer goods trade-in program last year and persistent property distress. These measures are far from enough to stabilize growth — Beijing will have to do much more in coming months to deliver annual GDP growth above 4.5% in 2026."
→ Caixin/RatingDog PMI (private survey, smaller export-oriented sample): 50.3 vs NBS 49.3 = divergence suggests PRIVATE/EXPORT firms doing better than STATE/DOMESTIC firms

COMMENT (HF sensitivity):
Dominant signal: China NBS PMI 49.3 = BACK TO CONTRACTION after single month of expansion (Dec 50.1). The divergence with Caixin PMI 50.3 is critical: STATE/DOMESTIC demand collapsing (NBS surveys large SOEs + domestic), PRIVATE/EXPORT holding (Caixin surveys SMEs + exporters). This confirms regime diagnosis: China's problem is DOMESTIC DEMAND COLLAPSE, not external weakness.
Secondary: Sub-indices paint clear picture — Production 50.6 (firms still producing), New Orders 49.2 (demand falling), New Export Orders 47.8 (export demand weakening too). This is classic "destocking" pattern: firms cutting production because inventories building.
Noise: January PMI often weak due to Lunar New Year seasonality (factories shut early, workers leave), so single month contraction not panic-worthy
Reaction-function impact (PBoC + Fiscal): NBS PMI 49.3 + Nomura assessment ("far from enough") = stimulus acceleration coming. Expect Q1 2026: (a) RRR cut 50bp, (b) MLF/LPR cut 10-15bp, (c) fiscal consumption vouchers expansion. March NPC (parliamentary session) likely announces fiscal deficit 4.0-4.5% of GDP (vs 3.8% prior).
Transmission: CNH weakening pressure (PMI contraction + policy easing = dovish CNY). PBoC likely allows CNY to drift to 7.40-7.50 vs USD (from current 7.30) to support exporters. China equity (CSI 300) vulnerable — PMI 49.3 = earnings downgrades coming, especially in consumer goods (PMI 48.3) and industrials. Only bright spot: high-tech (PMI 52.0) = continue to overweight AI/semiconductors (local champions like SMIC), underweight property/consumption.
Regime trigger: If Feb + March PMI also <50 (three consecutive months contraction) = PBOC forced into aggressive easing (100bp RRR cut + 25bp rate cut). Threshold: Q1 2026 IP growth <4.5% = panic mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CROSS-EM SYNTHESIS — WEEK 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEME: EXTREME DIVERGENCE — Growth/Inflation Scissors Opening

The Week 1 data reveals an unprecedented EM divergence, not just in growth rates but in the COMBINATION of growth and inflation outcomes:

**TIER 1 — PERFECT COMBO (Growth High + Inflation Low):**
• INDIA: IP 7.8% (26-month high) + PMI 56.8 Mfg / 59.3 Svc + CPI 1.33% YY (benign)
• TAIWAN: GDP 12.68% (38-year high) + CPI 1.7% YY (below target)

This is the "Goldilocks" scenario for EMs — strong growth without inflation pressure. Both benefit from EXTERNAL drivers (Taiwan = AI/chip exports; India = infrastructure spending + tech services exports) but India has stronger DOMESTIC resilience (consumer durables +12.3%, domestic new orders leading PMI).

**TIER 2 — STABLE (Growth Moderate + Inflation Anchored):**
• TURKEY: Reserves +6.36B (credibility rebuild) + inflation 47% YY but DECELERATING
• SOUTH AFRICA: Repo 6.75% hold, inflation mid-range, growth weak but stable

These are "muddling through" — no immediate crisis, but no breakout either.

**TIER 3 — STRESS (Growth Collapsing + Inflation/Policy Constraints):**
• CHINA: NBS PMI 49.3 (contraction) + domestic demand collapse + deflation risk (but easing)
• BRAZIL: Selic 15.00% (restrictive) + IP contracting + growth slowdown
• MEXICO: IGAE -0.1% (major miss) + core CPI sticky + Banxico easing limited

---

**CENTRAL BANK DIVERGENCE MAP:**

HIKING: None (RBA in DM is only hiker globally)
HOLDING (Hawkish Bias): Turkey CBT (50.00%, reserves improving but inflation 47%)
HOLDING (Neutral): India RBI (5.25%, no urgency either direction), Taiwan CBC (2.00%)
HOLDING (Dovish Bias): Brazil BCB (15.00%, first cut March/May), South Africa SARB (6.75%, gradual easing)
EASING PATH: Mexico Banxico (7.00% → 6.00% by end-2026), China PBoC (RRR/rate cuts coming Q1)

**CROSS-EM CENTRAL BANK URGENCY RANKING (Highest to Lowest):**
1. China PBoC (URGENT — PMI contraction, domestic demand collapse)
2. Brazil BCB (HIGH — growth slowing, inflation cooperating, easing imminent)
3. Mexico Banxico (MEDIUM — IGAE miss, core sticky, gradual easing)
4. South Africa SARB (LOW — patient, data-dependent, slow easing)
5. Turkey CBT (LOW — hawkish hold, reserves improving, credibility priority)
6. India RBI (ZERO — perfect hold setup, no action needed)
7. Taiwan CBC (ZERO — except for FX appreciation pressure from US)

---

**EM FX HIERARCHY (Week 1 Fundamentals):**

STRONGEST (Appreciation Pressure):
→ INR (growth 7.8% + inflation 1.33% + carry 4% real + current account improving)
→ TWD (GDP 12.68% + current account >15% GDP + US pressure to appreciate)

STABLE (Range-Bound):
→ ZAR (SARB patient, reserves stable, carry decent)
→ MXN (Banxico easing priced, IGAE weak but not crisis)

VULNERABLE (Depreciation Risk):
→ CNH (PMI 49.3 + easing coming + domestic demand collapse)
→ BRL (Selic 15% peak, cuts coming March, carry attractive but fading)
→ TRY (reserves improving BUT still fragile, inflation 47%, CA deficit)

**FX TRADES IMPLIED:**
Long INR vs CNH (growth differential + policy divergence)
Long TWD vs MXN (tech boom vs growth slowdown)
Avoid TRY (reserve improvement is tactical, structural problems remain)

---

**REGIME SHIFT SUMMARY:**

PRIOR REGIME (Early Jan 2026):
"China mixed signals; India strong; Taiwan tech boom intact; Turkey credibility rebuild; Brazil/Mexico gradual easing"

UPDATED REGIME (Post-Week 1):
**"EM DIVERGENCE EXTREME — India/Taiwan booming on domestic strength + tech exports (growth high + inflation low = perfect); China domestic demand collapsing (PMI 49.3, stimulus urgency rising); Brazil/Mexico growth softening (dovish pivots coming); Turkey reserves improving but fragile; South Africa patient."**

**DOMINANT CROSS-EM THEME:**
The GROWTH/INFLATION SCISSORS are opening — India/Taiwan have high growth + low inflation (central banks can hold forever), while China/Brazil/Mexico have low growth + policy constraints (China deflation, Brazil/Mexico inflation above target historically). This creates maximum EM FX dispersion and maximum alpha opportunity in EM equity selection (overweight India/Taiwan tech, underweight China consumer/property, neutral Brazil/Mexico).

**REGIME TRIGGERS (What Would Change This View):**

BULLISH TRIGGER (EM-wide rally):
→ China announces MASSIVE stimulus at March NPC (fiscal deficit >5% GDP + 100bp RRR cut + property support) = CNH stabilizes, EM risk-on
→ Fed cuts 50bp in March (dovish pivot) = EM FX rally across board
→ US-China trade deal (tariff rollback) = China export recovery, Taiwan/Korea benefit

BEARISH TRIGGER (EM-wide selloff):
→ Taiwan AI demand plateaus (Nvidia revenue miss, TSMC order cancellations) = Taiwan GDP collapses from 12.68% to <2%, TWD crashes
→ India inflation SPIKES (food shock, oil shock) = RBI forced to hike, INR weakens, equity selloff
→ China PMI <48 for 3 consecutive months (hard landing) = CNH 7.50+, EM contagion

NEUTRAL TRIGGER (Status Quo):
→ China gradual easing (25bp cuts, modest fiscal) without demand recovery = CNH drifts weaker, no EM contagion
→ India/Taiwan continue outperforming but at slower pace (India IP 6%, Taiwan GDP 8%) = still positive but less extreme
→ Brazil/Mexico easing cycles proceed as expected (gradual, data-dependent) = currencies range-bound

EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 19–JAN 23, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 23)

MONDAY 19 — RELEASED

CHINA — Urban Fixed Asset Investment (YTD) y/y (Dec)
Actual -3.8% vs Cons -3.0% vs Prior -2.6%
HF comment: Dominant signal is capex/real-economy inertia still negative — this is the “China domestic demand is not self-healing” datapoint and it missed meaningfully. Secondary: it reinforces the idea that any growth stabilization is being carried by external demand + policy-managed credit, not private-sector confidence. Reaction function: increases pressure for fiscal execution and targeted credit support; it does not force a broad monetary pivot if officials see credit already “ample.” Channel: CNH and EM beta through China domestic-demand proxy; commodities mixed (infrastructure demand tail risk).

CHINA — Industrial Output y/y (Dec)
Actual 5.2% vs Cons 5.0% vs Prior 4.8%
HF comment: Dominant signal: supply-side growth is holding up (beat, and rising vs prior). Secondary: IO strength can coexist with weak domestic demand if exports and inventory dynamics do the lifting — so don’t overread it as household reflation. Reaction function: gives policymakers cover to avoid “panic stimulus,” but doesn’t solve the investment drag. Channel: pro-cyclical risk sentiment supportive; sectoral (export/industrial complex) > broad CN demand.

CHINA — Retail Sales y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.9% vs Cons 1.2% vs Prior 1.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal: household demand remains the weak link (miss + down from prior). This is first-order because it speaks directly to the “confidence/savings trap.” Secondary: base effects and promotions can distort, but the level is still too soft to claim consumption is driving growth. Reaction function: keeps the burden on fiscal transfers/targeted consumption support rather than just liquidity. Channel: CN equities (consumer) negative, CNH mildly softer via “domestic demand still weak.”

CHINA — GDP y/y (Q4)
Actual 4.5% vs Cons 4.4% vs Prior 4.8%
HF comment: Dominant signal: growth beat a low bar but the composition matters: the GDP print can look fine while the demand mix deteriorates (weak retail, weak investment). Secondary: downshift vs prior confirms deceleration, but not collapse. Reaction function: supports the “managed landing” narrative; policymakers can keep doing targeted support + fiscal push rather than a 2009-style bazooka. Channel: global risk mildly supportive; CNH more sensitive to composition than headline.

CHINA — GDP q/q SA (Q4)
Actual 1.2% vs Cons 1.0% vs Prior 1.1%
HF comment: First-order: sequential momentum is better than priced. Secondary: q/q can be volatile and policy-smoothed; the key tension remains “production OK, demand weak.” Channel: modest risk support.

CHINA — Urban unemployment rate (Dec)
Actual 5.1% vs Prior 5.1% (no consensus)
HF comment: Flat → no new information. Labor slack remains a background constraint on consumption confidence; this doesn’t change the story.

TUESDAY 20 — RELEASED

CHINA — Loan Prime Rate 1Y (Jan)
Actual 3.00% (unchanged)
HF comment: Dominant signal: no marginal monetary easing — consistent with “liquidity ample / use targeted tools” stance. Secondary: unchanged LPR doesn’t mean policy is tight; it means policymakers prefer structural/targeted levers over headline rate cuts. Channel: rates limited; CNH supported at the margin by “no aggressive easing.”

CHINA — Loan Prime Rate 5Y (Jan)
Actual 3.50% (unchanged)
HF comment: Same logic, but this is the property-linked rate: holding it steady signals reluctance to re-open the “property reflation trade” aggressively. Channel: property sentiment remains constrained.

SOUTH AFRICA — Mining production y/y (Nov)
Actual -2.7% vs Cons 3.9% vs Prior 6.1%
HF comment: Dominant signal is hard growth shock (massive miss, swing from strong prior to contraction). Secondary: mining is volatile (base effects, idiosyncratic disruptions), but the size makes it hard to dismiss as noise. Reaction function: SARB won’t react to mining alone, but it raises downside growth risk and increases the asymmetry: if inflation stays contained, easing pressure rises. Channel: ZAR negative via growth/risk premium; rates supportive only if FX holds.

TAIWAN — Export orders y/y (Dec)
Actual 43.8% vs Cons 36.3% vs Prior 39.5% (revised 39.6%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: tech-cycle strength is still accelerating (big beat). Secondary: export orders are a forward proxy; it reinforces the “AI/semis demand still hot” narrative rather than broad domestic demand. Reaction function: gives the central bank more comfort that growth is fine; inflation becomes the constraint only if it reappears (not in this dataset). Channel: equities/tech beta, TWD supportive.

WEDNESDAY 21 — RELEASED

SOUTH AFRICA — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.2% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior -0.1%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation prints exactly on expectation and remains low. Secondary: m/m is noisy; key is that nothing is forcing SARB hawkishness. Channel: rates modestly supported; FX depends on growth risk (mining) and global risk.

SOUTH AFRICA — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.6% vs Cons 3.6% vs Prior 3.5%
HF comment: First-order: inflation remains benign and well-behaved. Second-order: with growth wobbling (mining miss), the mix tilts dovish if ZAR is stable. Reaction function: increases probability of a gradual easing bias rather than prolonged tightness. Channel: front-end rates supportive; ZAR depends on risk premium.

SOUTH AFRICA — Retail sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 3.5% vs Cons 2.5% vs Prior 2.9% (revised 3.0%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: consumer demand surprised to the upside, which partially offsets the mining shock. Secondary: this creates a “two-speed” picture — tradables/mining weak, domestic consumption firmer. Reaction function: prevents a clean dovish pivot narrative; SARB still watches inflation/FX first. Channel: supports domestic equities; rates impact limited.

THURSDAY 22 — RELEASED

SOUTH KOREA — GDP q/q advance (Q4)
Actual -0.3% vs Cons 0.1% vs Prior 1.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal is abrupt growth downside (negative print vs expected positive, huge decel). Secondary: Korea is sensitive to external/tech cycle; this is a warning that the cycle is not uniformly strong even if Taiwan orders look great. Reaction function: increases dovish pressure (or at least patience) at BoK, but policy may remain cautious if FX/household leverage constraints bite. Channel: KRW risk premium, rates rally.

SOUTH KOREA — GDP y/y advance (Q4)
Actual 1.5% vs Cons 1.9% vs Prior 1.8%
HF comment: Confirms the slowdown — the surprise is the q/q collapse, not just y/y drift.

TAIWAN — Unemployment rate (Dec)
Actual 3.35% (unchanged; no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: No impulse; labor market stable, not the constraint set.

POLAND — Employment y/y (Dec)
Actual -0.7% vs Cons -0.7% vs Prior -0.8%
HF comment: Stable weakness; not a catalyst. Labor market softness remains a background support for eventual easing, but wage growth is the real tradable signal.

POLAND — Industrial output y/y (Dec)
Actual 7.3% vs Cons 3.0% vs Prior -1.1%
HF comment: Dominant signal: massive upside growth surprise (swing from contraction to strong expansion). Secondary: watch base effects/energy distortions, but magnitude suggests a genuine turn in manufacturing momentum. Reaction function: this reduces near-term urgency to ease; shifts debate to “how fast can easing run without reigniting demand.” Channel: PLN supportive; rates bear flattening risk (less dovish).

POLAND — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual -2.5% vs Cons -2.3% vs Prior -2.4% (revised -2.3%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: pipeline still deflationary. Secondary: the combo (strong IO, negative PPI) is the best case for margins and disinflation — it pushes toward “soft landing with easing optionality.” Channel: rates supported on inflation, but growth surprise caps the move.

POLAND — Corporate sector wages y/y (Dec)
Actual 8.6% vs Cons 6.9% vs Prior 7.1%
HF comment: Dominant signal: wage pressure re-accelerated hard (big upside). This is the reaction-function killer: even with PPI negative, wages are what keep services inflation sticky. Reaction function: sharply reduces the room for aggressive easing; raises the bar for dovish guidance. Channel: rates selloff risk at the front-end; PLN supported via higher real-rate expectations.

TURKEY — Net FX reserves (w/e 12 Jan)
Actual 91.01B vs Prior 82.93B
HF comment: Dominant signal: credibility buffer improving materially — reserves are first-order for TRY regime stability. Secondary: the market will immediately ask “how much is valuation vs flows vs swaps,” but the direction still matters. Reaction function: gives CBT more ability to hold course without forced tightening, especially if FX pressure stays muted. Channel: TRY support, risk premium compresses.

TURKEY — CBT weekly repo rate (Jan)
Actual 37.00% vs Cons 36.50% vs Prior 38.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: less tight than prior, but tighter than expected (rate cut vs prior, yet hawkish vs consensus). This is a classic credibility move: ease a bit as inflation prints better, but do it cautiously to avoid FX destabilization. Secondary: combined with higher reserves, the cut becomes less risky — the regime can sustain carry without panic. Reaction function: shifts from “emergency-tight” to “managed normalization,” but only as long as reserves keep building. Channel: local rates (front-end), TRY via credibility.

TURKEY — O/N lending rate (Jan)
Actual 40.00% vs Prior 41.00%
HF comment: Corridor easing consistent with policy normalization; not the primary driver versus repo and reserves.

TURKEY — O/N borrowing rate (Jan)
Actual 35.50% vs Prior 36.50%
HF comment: Same.

TURKEY — Late liquidity window rate (Jan)
Actual 43.00% vs Prior 44.00%
HF comment: Same; signals less punitive backstop.

TURKEY — Gross FX reserves (w/e 12 Jan)
Actual 84.15B vs Prior 79.35B
HF comment: Confirms reserve rebuild; net is the more important metric, but gross moving the same way reinforces the credibility read.

MEXICO — CPI 1st half-month m/m (Jan)
Actual 0.31% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.17%
HF comment: Dominant signal: headline disinflation continues (big downside surprise). Secondary: half-month prints can be noisy, but the miss matters for near-term pricing. Reaction function: supports Banxico easing optionality, but core is the true constraint. Channel: rates rally, MXN carry supportive.

MEXICO — Core CPI 1st half-month m/m (Jan)
Actual 0.43% vs Cons 0.44% vs Prior 0.31%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core is only marginally below expectation and higher than prior — this blocks a dovish stampede. Secondary: the mix (soft headline, sticky-ish core) argues for gradual easing, not acceleration. Channel: front-end less bullish than headline alone would imply; MXN stable.

FRIDAY 23 — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC manufacturing flash PMI (Jan)
Actual 56.8 vs Cons 56.0 vs Prior 55.0
HF comment: Dominant signal: growth momentum re-accelerating (beat + higher vs prior). Secondary: PMIs can overreact, but a beat at these levels reinforces resilience. Reaction function: makes the RBI’s “no rush to ease” stance easier to defend even with low CPI; reduces dovish asymmetry. Channel: INR supportive via growth/carry, rates may cheapen modestly.

INDIA — HSBC services flash PMI (Jan)
Actual 59.3 vs Cons 58.5 vs Prior 58.0
HF comment: Dominant signal: services stays very hot — demand isn’t fading. Secondary: stronger services can keep underlying inflation sticky even if headline CPI is low. Reaction function: pushes away from near-term easing; supports “hold/patient.” Channel: rates (less dovish), INR supportive.

INDIA — HSBC composite flash PMI (Jan)
Actual 59.5 vs Cons 58.0 vs Prior 57.8
HF comment: Confirms broad strength. Key read: India is not in a “growth scare,” so low CPI doesn’t automatically translate into cuts.

TAIWAN — Industrial output y/y (Dec)
Actual 21.57% vs Prior 16.42% (no consensus)
HF comment: Dominant signal: hard data confirms the tech/industrial upswing. Secondary: magnitude likely includes base effects; still, direction is unambiguous. Reaction function: supports a “no easing urgency” stance; inflation is not forcing tightening either. Channel: equities/tech beta, TWD supportive.

MEXICO — IGAE economic activity y/y (Nov)
Actual -0.1% vs Cons 1.0% vs Prior 1.7% (revised 1.8%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: sharp growth downside surprise (big miss and deceleration). Secondary: this is the kind of print that changes the Banxico debate: growth becomes a binding constraint if it persists. Reaction function: increases easing pressure — but sticky core inflation still sets the pace. Channel: rates rally; MXN can weaken if growth fear dominates, but carry can offset if easing is seen as orderly.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

China delivered a clean “mixed but managed” packet: GDP/IO beat while retail + investment disappointed. Net: production/exports holding up, domestic demand still fragile → reinforces targeted support rather than bazooka stimulus.

Turkey was the biggest regime-shaper: reserves surged and CBT cut less than feared (hawkish vs consensus). Net: credibility constraints eased, allowing controlled normalization.

Poland had a violent mix: industrial output upside shock + wage re-acceleration. Net: growth better, but wage pressure kills dovish optionality — easing expectations get capped.

Korea and Mexico both printed material growth downside (Korea GDP q/q negative; Mexico IGAE miss). Net: pockets of EM are flashing growth vulnerability even while tech proxies (Taiwan) look strong.

What did NOT:

South Africa CPI being exactly on consensus didn’t shift anything; the mining shock mattered more for growth risk, while retail upside just made the signal mixed.

Taiwan unemployment had no information content.

Reaction function shifts:

PBoC/China: no inflation constraint; domestic-demand weakness keeps pressure on fiscal/targeted credit, but headline growth beats reduce urgency.

CBT/Turkey: reserves rebuild shifts the regime toward “normalize cautiously,” less forced-hawk risk.

Banxico/Mexico: headline inflation helps, but growth miss increases easing pressure; core keeps the pace gradual.

BoK/Korea: downside GDP surprise increases dovish pressure, but constraints remain FX/financial stability.

EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 12–JAN 16, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 16)

MONDAY 12 — RELEASED

INDIA — CPI inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 1.33% vs Cons 1.50% vs Prior 0.71%
HF comment: Dominant signal is inflation remains far below target-band “stress” even after the bounce — the downside miss matters because it keeps the RBI’s constraint set anchored to growth/real rates rather than inflation fear. Second-order: the direction (up from 0.71) reminds you the next few prints can move on food/base effects, but this isn’t a regime change unless it spills into core persistence. Reaction function: supports patience / optionality (no need to re-tighten), but doesn’t force an easing sprint absent growth weakness. Channel: front-end rates (limits hawkish repricing), INR mainly via global risk/carry.

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE: Soybean output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 178.00M vs Cons 176.35M vs Prior 175.00M
HF comment: First-order is positive supply shock (bigger crop) — bearish for local ag-price tail risk and supportive for the disinflation impulse into food/terms-of-trade if realised in exports. Second-order: the market won’t price “macro easing” off a single crop estimate; it prices the inflation expectations channel and how it feeds BCB comfort. Transmission: BRL/terms-of-trade + inflation breakevens; local rates benefit if this reinforces the “inflation doesn’t re-accelerate” narrative.

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE: Corn output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 131.00M vs Cons 132.46M vs Prior 131.00M
HF comment: Dominant signal is a small downside supply revision versus consensus (not vs prior), which offsets some of the soybean disinflation comfort at the margin. Second-order: corn matters more for domestic price sensitivity (feed chain) — but the shock size here looks more like noise unless repeated. Channel: limited unless it changes food inflation tails.

BRAZIL — World soy output 24/25 (Jan)
Actual 171.50M (no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Context print; market impact only if it changes the global balance enough to move CBOT and spill into local food/inflation pricing.

BRAZIL — World corn output 24/25 (Jan)
Actual 136.00M (no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Same — global price channel, not a Brazil-demand signal.

TUESDAY 13 — RELEASED

TURKEY — Current account balance (Nov)
Actual -3.996B vs Cons -3.250B vs Prior +0.457B
HF comment: Dominant signal is external deterioration: swing back to a sizeable deficit and worse than expected. In Turkey, this matters because the current account is a credibility constraint: deficits + reserve fragility = the market charges more FX risk premium. Second-order: one month can be volatile, but the prior was a surplus — the direction shift increases sensitivity to any TRY pressure. Reaction function: keeps CBT pinned to tight/credibility-first posture; it can’t sound relaxed even if CPI behaves. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

HUNGARY — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.3% vs Cons 3.3% vs Prior 3.8%
HF comment: Dominant signal: disinflation continues (down from 3.8) with no surprise vs consensus — that’s supportive but not catalyst. Second-order: as inflation drifts lower, the debate shifts to how fast easing can run without FX stress. Channel: rates mildly supportive, FX conditional.

CZECH REPUBLIC — CPI final m/m (Dec)
Actual -0.3% (final; no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Confirmation print; little impulse. Matters only as part of the broader “disinflation intact” backdrop.

CZECH REPUBLIC — CPI final y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.1% (final; no cons/prior provided)
HF comment: Confirms inflation near target; not tradable alone.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Current account (Nov)
Actual 8.16B vs Cons 8.67B vs Prior 16.83B
HF comment: Dominant signal is surplus still large but normalising. Second-order: for CZK, levels matter less than whether the external position stops being a buffer — here it remains a buffer. Channel: limited; FX support at the margin.

BRAZIL — Services output m/m (Nov)
Actual -0.1% vs Cons +0.2% vs Prior +0.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal is services momentum fading into Q4 — this matters because services is the domestic-demand core. Missing consensus and turning negative makes the “growth downshift” first-order. Second-order: composition matters: weakness in transport/info-comm is growth-negative and also hints at softer business activity. Reaction function: increases asymmetry toward less restrictive pricing as long as inflation doesn’t re-accelerate. Channel: rates bullish (dovish repricing), equities domestic cyclicals.

POLAND — Current account (Nov)
Actual -460M vs Cons +500M vs Prior +2,053M
HF comment: Dominant signal: swing to deficit vs both consensus and prior — external cushion erodes at the margin. Second-order: one print doesn’t rewrite the regime, but it raises FX sensitivity when global risk turns. Channel: PLN risk premium.

WEDNESDAY 14 — RELEASED

CHINA — Exports y/y (Dec)
Actual +6.6% vs Cons +3.0% vs Prior +5.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal is external demand resilience > expected (big beat). This is the market’s preferred China “growth” channel right now: exports offset domestic demand fragility. Second-order: the market mix matters: non-US strength doing the heavy lifting implies geopolitical/US drag is being diversified away, but it also reinforces the “surplus politics” tail. Reaction function: reduces near-term urgency for shock stimulus; keeps policy in “targeted + fiscal execution” mode. Channel: CNH + EM beta via risk sentiment, and global rates via growth optics only at the margin.

CHINA — Imports y/y (Dec)
Actual +5.7% vs Cons +0.9% vs Prior +1.9%
HF comment: Dominant signal is domestic absorption better than priced (also a beat). First-order takeaway: the “China demand is dead” narrative softens. Second-order: imports can be price/commodity driven — the key is whether this aligns with credit impulse (see TSF/loans). Channel: commodities + EM cyclicals; CNH supportive.

CHINA — Trade balance (USD, Dec)
Actual 114.10B vs Cons 113.60B vs Prior 111.68B
HF comment: Dominant signal: surplus remains very large and persistent — supportive for CNH stability but politically sensitive. Second-order: for markets, the rate of change in trade impulse matters more than the level; here impulse is strong. Channel: CNH + regional risk.

INDIA — WPI inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.83% vs Cons 0.30% vs Prior -0.32%
HF comment: Dominant signal is upstream inflation bounced hard (big upside vs consensus) — this is a second-order risk to the “India disinflation is effortless” story. But: WPI is not CPI; the key is whether it’s food/pimary-articles driven and whether it spills into retail inflation persistence. Reaction function: RBI won’t react to WPI alone, but it tightens the easing asymmetry if it foreshadows a CPI turn. Channel: rates (limits dovish repricing), INR marginal.

POLAND — NBP base rate (Jan)
Actual 4.00% vs Cons 4.00% vs Prior 4.00%
HF comment: No impulse; confirms status quo. Market trades guidance and inflation path.

THURSDAY 15 — RELEASED

CHINA — Total Social Financing (Dec)
Actual 2,210B vs Cons 2,000B vs Prior 2,490B
HF comment: Dominant signal: credit creation beat expectations (even if down from prior), which is important because China trades on the credit impulse, not the level. Second-order: the fact it’s below prior suggests no “flood,” more like targeted/managed support. Reaction function: consistent with “ample liquidity + fiscal doing the heavy lifting.” Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals; domestic rates less.

CHINA — M2 money supply y/y (Dec)
Actual 8.5% vs Cons 8.0% vs Prior 8.0%
HF comment: Dominant signal: liquidity conditions remain accommodative. Second-order: M2 can rise while private credit appetite is weak (high savings / cautious sentiment) — so treat as necessary but not sufficient. Channel: supports risk sentiment; limited direct market impulse.

CHINA — New yuan loans (Dec)
Actual 910B vs Cons 800B vs Prior 390B
HF comment: Dominant signal: credit flow stronger than expected, and the jump vs prior is meaningful. Second-order: composition matters (household vs corporate; short vs long). Reaction function: strengthens the case that policy is getting some traction without forcing a broad stimulus pivot. Channel: equity/risk beta > rates.

CHINA — Outstanding loan growth y/y (Dec)
Actual 6.4% vs Cons 6.3% vs Prior 6.4%
HF comment: Flat trend → no new information. It tells you the system isn’t accelerating structurally; impulses come through flow measures (TSF/loans), not the stock.

SOUTH KOREA — BoK base rate (Jan)
Actual 2.50% vs Cons 2.50% vs Prior 2.50%
HF comment: No impulse; confirms BoK patience. Market impact through forward guidance/risk, not the decision.

POLAND — CPI final m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.00% (final)
HF comment: Confirmation print; no impulse.

POLAND — CPI final y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.40% (final)
HF comment: Confirms low inflation; tradability low absent guidance shift.

INDIA — Unemployment rate (Dec)
Actual 4.80% vs Cons 4.80% vs Prior 4.70%
HF comment: Dominant signal: labor market stable — not a growth scare, not a boom. Second-order: it doesn’t loosen the RBI constraint set; it just reduces tail risk of abrupt demand weakness. Channel: minimal.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Retail sales WDA y/y (Nov)
Actual 4.6% vs Cons 3.4% vs Prior 2.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: consumption momentum stronger than expected. Second-order: strengthens the “soft landing” domestic demand story; can slow the pace of dovish repricing if the CNB debate is about easing speed. Channel: rates/FX mild.

CZECH REPUBLIC — Retail sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 2.7% vs Cons 1.5% (no prior provided)
HF comment: Same direction; confirms upside demand surprise.

BRAZIL — Retail sales m/m (Nov)
Actual 1.0% vs Cons 0.3% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: consumption resilience (clear beat). This is the counterweight to weak services output and soft industrial trend: the Brazil story is mixed, not one-way down. Second-order: retail strength can keep services inflation tails alive — but only if it persists. Reaction function: reduces probability of an aggressive dovish swing; supports “gradualism.” Channel: rates (limits dovish repricing), equities consumer.

BRAZIL — Retail sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 1.30% vs Cons 0.20% vs Prior 1.10%
HF comment: Reinforces the same: demand not collapsing. Market will reconcile this with weak services by focusing on composition and timing.

TURKEY — Gross FX reserves (w/e 5 Jan)
Actual 79.35B vs Prior 74.56B (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: reserve rebuild — crucial after last week’s disappointment. In Turkey, reserves are first-order because they determine how much credibility cushion exists for the FX regime. Second-order: one week doesn’t “fix” the story; the market needs persistence. Reaction function: gives CBT slightly more room to stay stable (and less risk of forced hawkish reaction), but doesn’t create dovish freedom. Channel: TRY support, risk premium compresses.

TURKEY — Net FX reserves (w/e 5 Jan)
Actual 82.93B vs Prior 76.89B (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Even more important than gross: net up materially is a credibility positive. This directly offsets the current-account negative from Tuesday, but doesn’t erase it — it just reduces near-term stress probability. Channel: FX first, then rates.

FRIDAY 16 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IBC-Br economic activity m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.70% vs Cons 0.30% vs Prior -0.20%
HF comment: Dominant signal: hard activity rebounded more than expected (and from a weak prior) — this meaningfully reduces “Q4 contraction” tails. Second-order: this forces a repricing of the earlier bearish read from services output: the regime is closer to “choppy stabilisation” than “clean downturn.” Reaction function: makes it harder to price a fast BCB dovish pivot unless inflation collapses; supports gradualism. Channel: rates (less dovish), equities/BRL mildly supportive.

POLAND — Net inflation y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.70% vs Cons 2.80% vs Prior 2.70%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation still contained; mild downside vs consensus is not a catalyst. Channel: minimal unless it alters forward guidance dynamics.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

China (trade + credit): Big beats in exports/imports and stronger-than-expected TSF/loans were the week’s core EM impulse — “China not worsening” with a modest credit impulse, supporting CNH and EM beta through risk sentiment.

Brazil (activity cross-currents): Services output was a genuine downside signal, but retail + IBC-Br pushed back hard. Net: Brazil is stabilising with volatility, not a clean downshift — this caps aggressive dovish pricing unless inflation provides a stronger green light.

Turkey (external vs reserves tug-of-war): Current account deterioration was negative, but the reserve rebuild late-week is first-order positive. Net: TRY risk premium becomes more two-sided again — still credibility-driven, but less one-way stress.

What did NOT:

Rates decisions (BoK, NBP) were pure holds with no new impulse.

Most “final” CPI prints in CEE were confirmation, not catalysts.

Reaction-function shifts:

RBI: CPI downside surprise keeps policy optionality; WPI upside is a caution flag, not a trigger — net still “patient.”

BCB: Hard activity resilience (IBC-Br) pushes against an aggressive dovish narrative; easing expectations remain data-dependent on inflation and sustained softness.

China policy: Data supports the stance of targeted monetary support + fiscal execution rather than shock stimulus.

CBT: Reserves improved, which reduces forced-hawk risk, but external balance volatility keeps credibility as the binding constraint.

EM MACRO — LIVE WEEK VIEW (JAN 5–JAN 9, 2026)

STATUS: Live as of FRIDAY close (JAN 9)

MONDAY 05 — RELEASED

CHINA — RatingDog Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 52.1 vs Cons 52.0 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, this keeps the “services still grinding higher” signal alive — not a re-acceleration, but it leans against the bearish tail where post-property drag finally bleeds into services. Second-order, it matters mainly through confidence/credit impulse optics rather than hard output: if services stays >50, policymakers can keep leaning on targeted easing instead of panic-style stimulus. Market channel: rates/FX via China-growth proxy (CNH + regional cyclicals) rather than domestic inflation.

TURKEY — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.89% vs Cons 0.98% vs Prior 0.87%
HF comment: Dominant signal is incremental disinflation (below consensus) without a “break” (near prior). Second-order is the policy asymmetry: CBT doesn’t need “good” CPI to stay tight — it needs CPI to stop being “bad.” This print reduces near-term urgency for additional tightening without creating room for early easing. Market channel: front-end rates first, FX via carry credibility (TRY stability remains more about policy consistency + reserves than a single CPI beat).

TUESDAY 06 — RELEASED

INDIA — HSBC Services Business Activity (Dec)
Actual 58.0 vs Cons 59.3 vs Prior 59.1
HF comment: First-order, this is a growth impulse downshift, but from very hot levels — cooling, not cracking. Second-order: marginally lowers the risk that demand-side services inflation stays sticky, but not enough to change “no urgency to ease.” Market channel: rates (caps hawkish repricing), INR mostly via global risk/carry rather than this print.

SOUTH AFRICA — Standard Bank Whole Economy PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.0 vs Prior 47.7 (no consensus provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: still sub-50 contraction, but the direction is less ugly (stabilisation, not recovery). Second-order: SARB won’t pivot on PMI, but a less weak activity backdrop slightly reduces the “growth pain” case for dovish pressure. Channel: ZAR via risk sentiment, rates only if it feeds a broader “less bad” sequence.

BRAZIL — IPC-Fipe Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.32% (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order, downside surprise supports the view inflation pressure is not re-igniting near term. Second-order: it reduces the hawkish tail but doesn’t buy BCB “freedom” if expectations/fiscal noise remain the binding constraint. Channel: front-end rates.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 50.1 vs Cons 53.7 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is services momentum lost (near stall) — big miss, hard to hand-wave. Second-order: strengthens “tight policy working through demand” narrative; needs hard-data confirmation to become regime. Channel: rates bullish, BRL conditional on risk tone.

BRAZIL — S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.6 vs Cons 52.1 (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order: composite <50 is a regime-warning if it persists. Second-order: market will quickly test whether this is breadth (demand) vs survey noise. Reaction function: lowers probability of hawkish repricing; doesn’t automatically accelerate easing without inflation confirmation. Channel: rates first, equities cyclicals second, BRL third.

BRAZIL — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 9.633B vs Cons 7.100B vs Prior 5.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal: external cushion strong — supportive for BRL resilience and risk premium. Second-order: does not offset domestic growth downshift implied by PMIs; it’s insurance, not growth fuel. Channel: FX via balance-of-payments comfort.

WEDNESDAY 07 — RELEASED

TAIWAN — CPI y/y NSA (Dec)
Actual 1.31% vs Cons 1.30% vs Prior 1.23%
HF comment: First-order: inflation remains contained; marginal uptick isn’t a constraint. Second-order: keeps the focus on the tech/trade cycle rather than CPI-driven policy. Channel: limited.

BRAZIL — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.87 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Treat as context, not catalyst. It only matters if it changes risk pricing in a way that spills into rates/FX — otherwise it’s background noise versus growth (PMIs) + inflation (IPCA) + fiscal headlines.

MEXICO — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.29 vs Cons 4.30 vs Prior 4.30
HF comment: Tiny downside vs consensus is non-event. Mexico trades on inflation-core credibility + growth prints; this doesn’t move the reaction function.

THURSDAY 08 — RELEASED

SOUTH AFRICA — Net $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 71.144B vs Cons 70.024B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal is a meaningful buffer improvement — positive for ZAR tail risk (funding/carry confidence). Second-order: if driven by valuation vs flows is the key nuance, but either way it reduces “fragility premium” at the margin. Channel: FX first, then local rates via lower risk premium.

SOUTH AFRICA — Gross $Gold & FX Reserves (Dec)
Actual 75.892B vs Cons 72.068B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Confirms the same story: headline reserve optics improved. Market cares less about level than trajectory when positioning is fragile; this helps stabilize the risk narrative.

TURKEY — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.86 vs Cons 2.88 vs Prior 2.87
HF comment: Not a catalyst. If anything, marginally “less risky” at the edges, but TRY trades on policy path + reserves; this does not substitute.

POLAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 7.73 vs Cons 7.73 (no prior provided)
HF comment: Pure placeholder; no impulse.

SOUTH AFRICA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 4.44 vs Cons 4.45 vs Prior 4.44
HF comment: Flat → no information content. Ignore.

BRAZIL — IGP-DI Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.10% vs Cons 0.15% vs Prior 0.01%
HF comment: First-order, pipeline inflation remains benign (below consensus), consistent with less pressure on downstream prices. Second-order: IGP can be noisy (commodities/FX pass-through), so the market uses it as confirmation rather than a driver — but in a week where growth is wobbling (PMIs), benign pipeline inflation strengthens the duration bid and reduces the hawkish tail. Channel: rates (front-end + belly).

SOUTH AFRICA — Manufacturing Production m/m (Nov)
Actual -1.1% vs Cons -0.2% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal is hard growth weakness — this is not “just survey.” Second-order: increases asymmetry in SARB debate: even if inflation is the mandate, weak activity raises political/market pressure against further hawkishness. Channel: rates bull-steepening risk (front-end relief) but watch ZAR: weak growth can increase FX sensitivity if risk-off hits.

TURKEY — Gross FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 74.56B vs Cons 76.98B (no prior provided)
HF comment: First-order negative for TRY optics — reserves are the binding credibility constraint. Second-order: one week doesn’t make a trend, but it raises sensitivity to any policy/macro disappointment: when reserves wobble, the market demands higher carry/vol premium. Channel: FX first, then local rates via risk premium.

TURKEY — Net FX Reserves (w/e 29 Dec)
Actual 76.89B vs Cons 79.77B (no prior provided)
HF comment: Same direction, worse implication: net matters more for “defendability.” Dominant signal: credibility buffer is not steadily building. Second-order: this makes CBT more reluctant to signal dovishness even if CPI prints nicer. Channel: TRY + front-end via credibility.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.0% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior 0.1%
HF comment: First-order: soft/flat — mild confirmation that the PMI slump isn’t pure noise, though the miss is small. Second-order: m/m is noisy; what matters is whether a run of prints starts to map into employment/credit. Channel: modest rates supportive.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -1.2% vs Cons -0.1% vs Prior -0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: this is a clear deterioration and validates the “growth downshift” narrative (now in hard data). Second-order: with growth weakening and pipeline inflation benign (IGP), the reaction-function balance tilts toward less restrictive pricing unless IPCA re-accelerates. Channel: rates (dovish repricing), equities cyclical risk, BRL depends on global risk + fiscal.

MEXICO — Headline Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.28% vs Cons 0.40% vs Prior 0.66%
HF comment: First-order disinflation is back on track. Second-order: headline matters less than core for Banxico, but a soft headline reduces pressure on the narrative and lowers the risk premium embedded in rates. Channel: rates supportive, FX mildly positive via carry stability.

MEXICO — Core Inflation m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.42% vs Prior 0.19%
HF comment: Dominant signal: core is not collapsing — it’s basically as expected and higher than prior. This is the “check” on dovish extrapolation: you can’t declare victory. Second-order: the combo (soft headline, steady core) supports a gradual easing path rather than aggressive cuts. Channel: front-end (keeps easing priced but limits acceleration), MXN stable.

MEXICO — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 3.69% vs Cons 3.80% vs Prior 3.80%
HF comment: First-order: y/y drift lower supports the disinflation story. Second-order: market still trades monthly core more than this level, but it helps anchor medium-term expectations. Channel: low-to-moderate rates support.

MEXICO — PPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.5% (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Second-order. Without context it’s not tradable; watch only if it starts feeding a trend that reappears in CPI goods.

MEXICO — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 2.1% vs Cons 2.4%
HF comment: Marginally softer pipeline — supportive for the “no reflation shock” view, but still secondary versus core CPI.

FRIDAY 09 — RELEASED

CHINA — PPI y/y (Dec)
Actual -1.9% vs Cons -2.0% vs Prior -2.2%
HF comment: Dominant signal: producer deflation is less negative — modest reflation progress at the margin. Second-order: this is still deflationary, so it doesn’t change the policy regime; it just slightly reduces the “profit squeeze” tail risk. Reaction function: keeps room for support, but less urgency than when PPI was accelerating down. Channel: CNH + EM cyclicals via “China isn’t worsening” optics.

CHINA — CPI y/y (Dec)
Actual 0.8% vs Cons 0.8% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: First-order: CPI remains lowflation — no demand overheating signal, no constraint on easing. Second-order: stable/low CPI plus less-negative PPI is the “best possible” configuration for authorities: room to stimulate without an inflation penalty, while signaling incremental traction. Channel: muted; helps risk assets more through narrative than through rates.

CHINA — CPI m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.2% vs Cons 0.1% vs Prior -0.1%
HF comment: Mostly second-order/seasonal. Directionally consistent with “deflation scare not intensifying,” but not regime-changing on its own.

CHINA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 2.28 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

INDIA — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 3.12 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

THAILAND — Overall Comprehensive Risk (Q1)
Actual 5.10 (no consensus/prior provided)
HF comment: Context only.

TURKEY — Industrial Production unadj m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.4% vs Cons -1.8% vs Prior 0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: activity did not roll over as feared (huge beat vs consensus). Second-order: in Turkey this creates a policy tension: CPI is edging better, but growth resilience + reserve slippage means CBT cannot relax credibility posture. Net: reduces “hard landing” concerns but doesn’t buy dovishness. Channel: local equities/growth optics positive; rates/FX still dominated by reserves.

TAIWAN — Imports y/y (Dec)
Actual 14.90% vs Cons 28.10% vs Prior 45.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: cycle momentum cooled sharply (big downside miss). Second-order: still strong in absolute terms, but the rate-of-change matters for semiconductor-cycle narratives. Channel: regional equities/tech beta; FX modest.

TAIWAN — Exports y/y (Dec)
Actual 43.40% vs Cons 46.00% vs Prior 56.00%
HF comment: First-order: still very strong, but decelerating. Second-order: the pair with imports (both slowing) leans toward “cycle normalising,” not collapsing. Channel: equities/tech beta > rates.

TAIWAN — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 19.430B vs Cons 16.100B vs Prior 16.090B
HF comment: Dominant signal: surplus bigger than expected supports TWD carry/defensive profile. Second-order: surplus can widen even as growth impulse cools; don’t confuse level with momentum. Channel: FX supportive, modest.

BRAZIL — IPCA m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.33% vs Cons 0.35% vs Prior 0.18%
HF comment: Dominant signal: slight downside vs consensus, but inflation is higher than prior — so not a clean disinflation impulse. Second-order: in a week where growth is weakening (PMIs + industrial y/y), the market can live with “not worse than feared” inflation; what would hurt is an upside surprise that reanchors expectations higher. Reaction function: keeps easing/neutral bias intact; doesn’t force hawkish repricing. Channel: rates supportive, but less powerful than if m/m had fallen vs prior.

BRAZIL — IPCA y/y (Dec)
Actual 4.26% vs Cons 4.30% vs Prior 4.46%
HF comment: First-order: trend down continues — supportive. Second-order: y/y helps expectations anchoring; the market still trades the monthly composition, but this reduces hawkish tail risk. Channel: rates.

MEXICO — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -0.8% vs Cons -1.2% vs Prior -0.4%
HF comment: Dominant signal: still negative growth, but less weak than feared. Second-order: doesn’t overturn the “soft activity” story; it just reduces the hard-landing tail. Reaction function: keeps Banxico easing optionality alive as long as core behaves. Channel: modestly supportive for MXN (risk), rates steady.

MEXICO — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.6% vs Cons 0.0% vs Prior 0.7%
HF comment: m/m beat is supportive but second-order; the y/y trend is what matters for regime. Useful mainly as confirmation that the downside growth narrative isn’t accelerating.

BOTTOM LINE — WEEK SYNTHESIS

What actually mattered:

Brazil: The week was about growth downside becoming first-order (PMIs collapsing into <50 + industrial output y/y worsening). Inflation didn’t “save” the hawkish tail, and pipeline inflation stayed benign (IGP-DI). Net: market bias shifts toward dovish repricing in rates unless fiscal shocks intervene.

Mexico: Inflation mix was the key — headline soft, core steady/firm → supports gradual easing, not a dovish stampede. Activity prints helped reduce hard-landing tails but didn’t flip the regime.

Turkey: CPI slightly better, but reserves disappointment is the binding constraint. IP surprise beat reduces growth fear but tightens the credibility asymmetry: CBT can’t afford to sound dovish while reserves wobble.

China: CPI still low, PPI less negative — “stabilisation without inflation constraint.” Supports risk sentiment at the margin, but not a “reflation regime shift.”

What did NOT matter:

“Overall Comprehensive Risk” prints were non-catalysts across countries (no material signal unless they swing hard).

Taiwan CPI didn’t constrain anything; Taiwan trade momentum mattered more than price.

Reaction-function shifts (or not):

BCB: growth shock upgrades dovish asymmetry; inflation data did not fight it.

Banxico: disinflation continues, but core keeps the committee cautious → path remains gradual.

CBT: credibility/reserves dominate; easing talk remains constrained even with softer CPI.

China: policy retains room for support; no inflation penalty, but no clear demand re-acceleration either.
