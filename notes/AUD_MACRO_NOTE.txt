AUSTRALIA (AUD) MACRO — LIVE MONTH VIEW (JANUARY 2026)

STATUS: Live as of JAN 28 close

Macro regime lens (AUD): AUD is trading the intersection of China-linked external pulse + domestic disinflation path + labor-market tightness. In January, the data mostly did one thing: re-price “RBA can stay patient, but the bar to cut is still higher than the market wants when the labor market re-accelerates and services reheat.”

JAN 28 — RELEASED (INFLATION: HARD CONSTRAINT CHECK)
AUSTRALIA — CPI q/q (Q4)

Actual 0.6% vs Cons 0.6% vs Prior 1.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal: disinflation continues, but this is not the dovish “all clear” — it’s a confirmation that the inflation level is improving while the composition remains the real battleground (services/sticky vs tradables). Secondary: the big drop vs prior means the RBA’s restrictive stance is biting, but Q4 prints in Australia can be affected by seasonal/one-offs; the market will ask whether this is repeatable into H1. Reaction function: this keeps the RBA in “wait-and-verify” mode: it removes the need to sound hawkish, but it doesn’t force a near-term cut unless labor demand breaks. Transmission: front-end rates stable-to-bullish; AUD impact depends on how much is already priced—typically AUD-supportive vs cut-heavy expectations, but capped if global risk softens.

AUSTRALIA — CPI y/y (Q4)

Actual 3.6% vs Cons 3.6% vs Prior 3.2%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation is still above comfort, and the y/y drift up vs prior is exactly why the RBA doesn’t pivot on one good q/q print. Secondary: y/y can be base-effecty; professionals care more about trimmed/weighted median momentum. Reaction function: reinforces the “RBA needs proof that underlying inflation is trending down, not just headline.” Transmission: limits aggressive front-end rally; AUD supported by “cuts not imminent.”

AUSTRALIA — RBA Weighted Median CPI q/q (Q4)

Actual 0.9% vs Cons 0.8% vs Prior 1.0%
HF comment: Dominant signal: underlying inflation is stickier than the headline narrative (upside vs consensus). This is the print that matters for the reaction function because it’s closest to the RBA’s “true neutral vs restrictive” test in a services-heavy inflation environment. Secondary: one quarter doesn’t make a trend, but this blocks any clean “disinflation is done” story. Reaction function: cuts get pushed out unless subsequent labor and services momentum soften. The RBA can acknowledge progress, but it cannot endorse easing with this underlying momentum. Transmission: front-end rates cheapen vs dovish positioning; AUD tends to be supported on relative rates.

Note: Your dataset cuts off after “RBA Weighted Medn CPI y/y …”. I’m not adding numbers that aren’t shown.

JAN 22 — RELEASED (LABOR + PMI: THE “DOMESTIC MOMENTUM” TEST)
AUSTRALIA — Employment change (Dec)

Actual +65.2k vs Cons +30.0k vs Prior -28.7k
HF comment: Dominant signal: labor demand is re-accelerating hard. This is first-order because Australia is a wage/services inflation economy: strong employment means the “last mile” inflation fight remains alive. Secondary: monthly jobs are noisy, but the direction + magnitude matters because it reverses the “labor market is cooling” narrative. Reaction function: pushes the RBA away from any near-term easing comfort; raises the threshold for “disinflation is sufficient.” Transmission: rates selloff risk at the front-end; AUD supported on rates differential, especially vs currencies where labor is weakening.

AUSTRALIA — Unemployment rate (Dec)

Actual 4.1% vs Cons 4.4% vs Prior 4.3%
HF comment: Dominant signal: labor market still tight; unemployment fell meaningfully vs consensus. Secondary: participation can distort, but here participation didn’t surge (see below), so the fall in unemployment looks “real.” Reaction function: reinforces a restrictive hold bias: RBA cannot claim slack is opening fast enough to remove wage pressure risk. Transmission: front-end rates less dovish; AUD supported.

AUSTRALIA — Participation rate (Dec)

Actual 66.7% vs Cons 66.8% vs Prior 66.7%
HF comment: Dominant signal: participation didn’t “explain away” the unemployment move. Secondary: stable participation makes the jobs/unemployment combo more credible. Reaction function: strengthens the labor-tightness read-through.

AUSTRALIA — S&P Global PMI Flash (Jan): Manufacturing

Actual 51.6 vs Prior 52.4
HF comment: Dominant signal: manufacturing remains in modest expansion; slight easing is second-order. Secondary: in Australia, manufacturing is less binding than services for inflation dynamics. Reaction function: limited.

AUSTRALIA — S&P Global PMI Flash (Jan): Services

Actual 51.1 vs Prior 56.0
HF comment: Dominant signal: services momentum cooled sharply vs the prior flash level (large step-down). Secondary: services PMI is the closest activity proxy for the RBA’s domestic demand/inflation linkage; a drop matters if it persists. Reaction function: this is the main offset to the hot labor print—keeps the RBA from sounding hawkish, but the labor data still dominates near-term policy risk. Transmission: reduces AUD upside tail from jobs; supports rates duration.

AUSTRALIA — S&P Global Composite PMI Flash (Jan)

Actual 51.0 vs Prior 55.5
HF comment: Dominant signal: broad activity pulse cooled; confirms services slowdown. Secondary: still above 50 → not recessionary, more “cooling at the margin.” Reaction function: helps the RBA maintain patience.

JAN 21 — RELEASED (CYCLE SIGNAL: LEADING INDICATORS)
AUSTRALIA — Composite Leading Index m/m (Dec)

Actual -0.02% vs Prior 0.08%
HF comment: Dominant signal: forward momentum is softening, not collapsing. Secondary: leading indices can be model-driven/noisy, but the sign flip supports the “growth is slowing” narrative. Reaction function: slightly dovish at the margin—only relevant if labor subsequently weakens. Transmission: modest support for rates; AUD impact limited.

JAN 8 — RELEASED (EXTERNALS: AUD FUNDING / TERMS-OF-TRADE TONE)
AUSTRALIA — Balance on Goods (Nov)

Actual 2,936M vs Cons 4,900M vs Prior 4,353M
HF comment: Dominant signal: external surplus compressed materially (big miss). For AUD, the external account is a slow-moving anchor: weaker goods balance reduces the cushion that typically supports AUD in risk-off. Secondary: monthlies can swing with commodity prices and shipment timing; the market cares whether this is trend or one-off. Reaction function: not an RBA driver directly, but if external income weakens it can tighten overall financial conditions and lower “true neutral” effective stance. Transmission: AUD slightly negative via terms-of-trade optics; rates impact second-order.

AUSTRALIA — Goods/Services Exports (Nov)

Actual +4.3% (prior -2.9%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: export volumes rebound; helpful for growth. Secondary: the key is whether prices (ToT) confirm—without that, AUD support is limited. Transmission: mild AUD support, but offset by trade balance miss.

AUSTRALIA — Goods/Services Imports (Nov)

Actual +2.4% (prior +0.2%)
HF comment: Dominant signal: domestic demand/import pull is firmer, which narrows the balance. Secondary: can be capex-related (less inflationary) or consumption-related (more inflationary); data here doesn’t split it. Reaction function: if import growth is demand-led, it aligns with “sticky domestic demand.” Transmission: trade balance negative; inflation implications ambiguous.

JAN 7 — RELEASED (HOUSING/CONSTRUCTION + MONTHLY CPI SIGNALS)
AUSTRALIA — Building Approvals (Nov)

Actual +15.2% vs Cons +2.0% vs Prior -6.1%
HF comment: Dominant signal: housing pipeline re-accelerated sharply. This matters because housing is a real economy + services inflation channel (rents, construction costs, domestic demand). Secondary: approvals are volatile and can be policy/seasonality-sensitive; market will want follow-through in commencements and prices. Reaction function: on its own, not enough to move the RBA—but combined with tight labor it reinforces “financial conditions are not restrictive enough to crush demand.” Transmission: AUD mildly supportive via growth; rates less dovish.

AUSTRALIA — Building Approvals y/y (Nov)

Actual +6.4% vs Cons +4.4%
HF comment: Confirms the acceleration at trend level. Second-order but supportive of the same narrative.

AUSTRALIA — Monthly CPI m/m (Nov)

Actual 0.00% vs Cons 0.30% vs Prior 0.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: near-term inflation momentum looked benign in the monthly gauge. Secondary: monthly CPI is noisy and not the RBA’s primary target for decisions (they look through). Reaction function: helps cap hawkish tails, but not sufficient versus underlying measures.

AUSTRALIA — Monthly CPI y/y (Nov)

Actual 3.40% vs Cons 3.70% vs Prior 3.80%
HF comment: Dominant signal: headline disinflation continued. Secondary: if underlying measures don’t follow, the RBA won’t pivot. Transmission: supports duration; AUD impact via rates.

AUSTRALIA — Trimmed Mean CPI m/m SA (Nov)

Actual 0.30% vs Cons 0.25% vs Prior 0.30%
HF comment: Dominant signal: underlying inflation momentum did not ease (upside vs consensus, unchanged vs prior). This is the real “tension print” against benign headline monthly CPI. Reaction function: keeps the RBA cautious: headline good news doesn’t translate to cuts if trimmed mean is sticky. Transmission: limits front-end rally; AUD supported on relative rates.

AUSTRALIA — Trimmed Mean CPI y/y SA (Nov)

Actual 3.2% vs Cons 3.3% vs Prior 3.3%
HF comment: Underlying is slowly improving y/y, but not collapsing—still consistent with “restrictive hold.”

AUSTRALIA — Weighted Median CPI m/m SA (Nov)

Actual 0.40% vs Prior 0.30%
HF comment: Dominant signal: underlying breadth firmed sequentially. Second-order but reinforces “sticky core.”

AUSTRALIA — Weighted Median CPI y/y SA (Nov)

Actual 3.40% (no consensus shown)
HF comment: Level still too high for comfort; supports patience.

JAN 5 — RELEASED (SURVEY CONFIRMATION)
AUSTRALIA — S&P Global Services PMI Final (Dec)

Actual 51.0 vs Prior 51.1
HF comment: Steady expansion; low signal.

AUSTRALIA — S&P Global Composite PMI Final (Dec)

Actual 51.1 vs Prior 51.0
HF comment: Confirms modest growth, not overheating.

JAN 1 — RELEASED (SURVEY START POINT)
AUSTRALIA — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI Final (Dec)

Actual 52.2 vs Prior 51.6
HF comment: Manufacturing improved into year-end. Secondary for RBA; helps “soft landing” narrative.

MONTH SYNTHESIS — AUD (JANUARY 2026)
What actually mattered

RBA constraint-set didn’t clear: Headline CPI cooled, but underlying (weighted median / trimmed) stayed sticky enough to block an early cut narrative.

Labor re-accelerated (jobs + unemployment surprise): this is the key reason the RBA can’t pivot even with decent headline inflation.

Activity pulse cooled late-month (PMI flash): provides the main offset to the labor heat, supporting “patient hold” rather than renewed hawkishness.

What did not

Manufacturing PMI levels (positive but not binding).

Leading index alone (only matters if labor cracks).

Trade balance swing without confirmation of trend.

Reaction-function shift (RBA)

January locked in a high bar for cuts: the RBA can acknowledge progress, but with tight labor + sticky underlying inflation, it must keep the restrictive stance credible.

The only path to cuts is clear slack creation (jobs/unemployment) and continued easing in underlying inflation prints.

AUD transmission summary

Rates channel dominates AUD here: sticky underlying + strong labor = less dovish pricing → AUD supported on relative differentials.

External/trade softness is a tail risk amplifier: if global risk or China turns, a weaker external cushion makes AUD more vulnerable.

Working AUD regime call (end-Jan):
“Disinflation is real, but not decisive; labor keeps the RBA patient and the market honest. AUD behaves like a rates-differential currency with a China/risk overlay.”
