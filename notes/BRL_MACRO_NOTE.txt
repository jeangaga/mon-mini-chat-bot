JAN 30 — Primary Budget Balance (Dec)
Actual -14.4B vs Cons +3.0B vs Prior +18.2B
HF comment: First-order negative for BRL risk premium. Fiscal swing is regime-relevant, not seasonal noise. Reaction function tightens: BCB less able to validate dovish pricing even with cooperative inflation. Transmission: BRL weaker via risk premium, rates bear-steepening risk.

JAN 29 — IGP-M Inflation m/m (Jan)
Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.41% vs Prior -0.01%
HF comment: Pipeline inflation re-accelerates. Second-order alone, but interacts negatively with fiscal stress. Reaction function: reinforces BCB caution on easing. Transmission: mild rates pressure; BRL only if pass-through narrative builds.

JAN 28 — Selic Rate Decision
Actual 15.00% vs Cons 15.00% vs Prior 15.00%

JAN 26 — Foreign Direct Investment (Dec)
Actual -5.25B vs Cons +1.0B vs Prior +9.82B
HF comment: Major negative shock. Capital-account deterioration is first-order BRL-negative. Reaction function tightens via FX sensitivity. Transmission: BRL weaker, rates via higher risk premium.

JAN 15 — Retail Sales m/m (Nov)
Actual +1.0% vs Cons +0.3% vs Prior +0.5%
HF comment: Consumption resilience offsets weak services. Caps aggressive dovish repricing. Transmission: rates less bullish; BRL neutral.

BRAZIL (BRL) MACRO — LIVE MONTH VIEW (JANUARY 2026)

STATUS: Live as of JAN 30 close

====================================================
JAN 30 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Primary Budget Balance (Dec)
Actual -14.4B vs Cons +3.0B vs Prior +18.2B
HF comment: Dominant signal: fiscal is the binding constraint again. The miss is large enough to re-price the regime: it’s not “month-end seasonality,” it’s a reminder that Brazil’s disinflation story is always conditional on fiscal discipline and financing optics. Secondary: this kind of swing mechanically pushes investors to re-open the “fiscal → term premium → BRL → inflation expectations” feedback loop; even if the cash deficit is volatile, the market trades the direction of credibility. Reaction function: this does not force immediate Selic action, but it raises the bar for dovish guidance and shifts the committee’s asymmetry: they can tolerate weaker growth, but they cannot tolerate a BRL/fiscal-driven expectations un-anchoring. Transmission: BRL via risk premium (wider fiscal tail = wider FX risk premium), rates via bear-steepening risk (term premium), and second-order via inflation breakevens if BRL weakens.

====================================================
JAN 29 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IGP-M Inflation Index m/m (Jan)
Actual 0.41% vs Cons 0.41% vs Prior -0.01%
HF comment: Dominant signal: pipeline inflation is no longer “helpful” (jump from negative prior), even if it’s exactly on consensus. On its own, it’s a second-order print; in a month where fiscal optics deteriorated, it becomes a confirmation risk: commodity/FX-sensitive pipeline measures are the first place pass-through shows up. Secondary: the key isn’t the level, it’s whether IGP stops mean-reverting and starts to map into CPI goods/services expectations. Reaction function: doesn’t change the Selic baseline, but it reduces BCB’s willingness to “look through” any near-term CPI noise if BRL is pressured. Transmission: rates mildly hawkish at the margin; BRL only moves if markets decide pass-through risk has returned (usually via breakevens).

====================================================
JAN 28 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Selic Interest Rate (Jan 28)
Actual 15.00% vs Cons 15.00% vs Prior 15.00%
HF comment: Dominant signal: policy stays restrictive because the constraint set hasn’t cleared. The hold is unsurprising; what matters is that the committee is effectively telling you “inflation progress is not enough to offset fiscal/expectations risk.” Secondary: at 15%, the real-rate stance remains punitive for domestic demand — so if growth weakens, the market will try to front-run easing; the CB’s job is to prevent that from turning into BRL weakness and expectation drift. Reaction function: unchanged in level, but asymmetry is the story — easier to stay tight than to validate easing while fiscal/flows look unstable. Transmission: direct market move small; BRL support only through credibility optics and carry anchoring.

====================================================
JAN 27 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IPCA-15 Mid-Month CPI m/m (Jan)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.21% vs Prior 0.25%
HF comment: Dominant signal: disinflation is still grinding. Not a “break,” but it keeps the near-term path cooperative. Secondary: the important interaction is with BRL/fiscal stress: a benign monthly print reduces the risk that FX weakness immediately translates into an inflation scare. Reaction function: this supports gradualism and reduces hawkish tails, but it does not unlock cuts because the CB must be sure expectations and FX are stable (fiscal constraint). Transmission: rates supportive (front-end relief), BRL supportive only via lower pass-through anxiety.

BRAZIL — IPCA-15 Mid-Month CPI y/y (Jan)
Actual 4.50% vs Cons 4.51% vs Prior 4.41%
HF comment: Dominant signal: y/y drift higher is not news (in-line). This is not the metric that shifts BCB; the committee trades the monthly composition and expectations. Transmission: minimal unless investors use it as narrative ammo alongside fiscal shocks (rare without a monthly upside surprise).

====================================================
JAN 26 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Current Account (Dec)
Actual -3.363B vs Cons -5.300B vs Prior -4.943B
HF comment: Dominant signal: external deficit narrower than feared — this is BRL-supportive as a near-term funding comfort. Secondary: it’s still a deficit, so it doesn’t create structural BRL strength; it just reduces “immediate stress” probability. Reaction function: lowers the probability that FX weakness becomes the binding constraint (all else equal), but fiscal and capital flows still dominate. Transmission: BRL modest support; rates only via FX pass-through channel.

BRAZIL — Foreign Direct Investment (Dec)
Actual -5.248B vs Cons +1.000B vs Prior +9.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal: capital-account deterioration is first-order BRL-negative. The sign flip (inflow → outflow) is exactly the type of print that makes the market re-price “quality funding” and ask whether the BoP is now relying too heavily on trade. Secondary: yes, monthly FDI is lumpy — but lumpy prints still matter when positioning is carry-heavy because they shift the perceived “defendability” of BRL in risk-off. Reaction function: increases BCB’s sensitivity to FX and to communication mistakes; it reduces tolerance for dovish hints. Transmission: BRL negative via higher risk premium; rates via higher term premium and inflation-risk premium.

====================================================
JAN 15 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Retail Sales m/m (Nov)
Actual 1.0% vs Cons 0.3% vs Prior 0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: demand is more resilient than the PMI/growth narrative suggested. This matters because it pushes back against the idea that the economy is rolling over cleanly under high real rates. Secondary: resilience can be “last gasp” (credit/seasonality), so the market needs confirmation from labor/credit; but as a print, it reduces the probability of an imminent hard landing. Reaction function: it caps aggressive dovish repricing; if consumption holds up, BCB can stay restrictive without being accused of overtightening. Transmission: rates less bullish; BRL neutral-to-supportive via growth differential.

BRAZIL — Retail Sales y/y (Nov)
Actual 1.30% vs Cons 0.20% vs Prior 1.10%
HF comment: Confirms the same story — stabilization with upside skew.

====================================================
JAN 13–14 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — Service Sector Growth m/m (Nov)
Actual -0.1% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior 0.3% (revised higher earlier in month per table)
HF comment: Dominant signal: services momentum faded — this is important because services is where sticky inflation lives. Secondary: composition matters; weakness in transport/info tends to be more growth-cyclically sensitive than “core” services demand, but the sign flip still raises growth risk. Reaction function: soft services increases dovish asymmetry only if inflation expectations remain anchored and BRL is stable. Transmission: rates bullish; BRL effect depends on whether markets read it as “cuts sooner” (BRL negative if it reduces carry credibility) or “soft landing” (neutral).

====================================================
JAN 12 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE Soybean Output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 178.00M vs Cons 176.00M vs Prior 175.00M
HF comment: Dominant signal: supply shock is disinflationary. This is a “tails” print for Brazil: it reduces food-inflation upside risk and can support terms-of-trade inflows if export volumes follow. Secondary: commodity prices can still overwhelm volumes; this helps only if it translates to realized trade/FX. Reaction function: gives BCB marginal comfort via food/expectations channel, but not enough to counter fiscal risk. Transmission: BRL supportive via ToT; breakevens lower.

BRAZIL — USDA/WASDE Corn Output 25/26 (Jan)
Actual 131.00M vs Cons 131.00M vs Prior 131.00M
HF comment: Neutral.

====================================================
JAN 09 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IPCA Inflation Index m/m (Dec)
Actual 0.33% vs Cons 0.35% vs Prior 0.18%
HF comment: Dominant signal: inflation is manageable, not collapsing. This is “good enough” for stability, not “good enough” for cuts. Secondary: the rise vs prior is a reminder that the last mile is sticky, especially in services-related components. Reaction function: supports restrictive hold; doesn’t create easing urgency. Transmission: rates modestly supported; BRL via pass-through comfort.

BRAZIL — IPCA Inflation Index y/y (Dec)
Actual 4.26% vs Cons 4.30% vs Prior 4.46%
HF comment: Disinflation trend intact; helps medium-term expectations.

====================================================
JAN 08 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — IGP-DI Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.10% vs Cons 0.15% vs Prior 0.01%
HF comment: Dominant signal: benign pipeline early in the month — the “good” version of IGP, before IGP-M re-accelerated in Jan. Reaction function: supportive for duration; Transmission: rates bullish.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output m/m (Nov)
Actual 0.0% vs Cons 0.2% vs Prior 0.1%
HF comment: Flat output confirms sluggish momentum.

BRAZIL — Industrial Output y/y (Nov)
Actual -1.2% vs Cons -0.1% vs Prior -0.5%
HF comment: Dominant signal: hard activity deterioration — corroborates weak survey tone. Reaction function: dovish asymmetry rises conditional on fiscal/FX. Transmission: rates bullish, BRL depends on risk regime.

====================================================
JAN 06 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — S&P Global Services PMI (Dec)
Actual 50.1 vs Cons 53.7
HF comment: Dominant signal: growth decelerated sharply (near-stall). Secondary: surveys can mean-revert; needs hard confirmation (later came partly via industrial y/y weakness). Reaction function: supportive for dovish pricing unless inflation/fiscal block. Transmission: rates first; BRL conditional (carry vs growth trade-off).

BRAZIL — S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)
Actual 49.6 vs Cons 52.1
HF comment: Sub-50 is the “regime warning.” It became less clean once retail later surprised stronger.

BRAZIL — Trade Balance (Dec)
Actual 9.633B vs Cons 7.100B vs Prior 5.820B
HF comment: Dominant signal: external buffer strong. This is BRL-positive insurance, not a growth engine. Transmission: BRL support via BoP optics; limited rate impact.

BRAZIL — IPC-Fipe Inflation Index (Dec)
Actual 0.20% vs Cons 0.32%
HF comment: Confirms disinflation tails; trims hawkish risk.

====================================================
JAN 02 — RELEASED

BRAZIL — S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Dec)
Actual 48.8 vs Cons 47.6 vs (prior not provided)
HF comment: Dominant signal: still contractionary — improvement, but not expansion. This is not the data that changes BCB; it’s a growth tone-setter. Transmission: limited.

====================================================
MONTH SYNTHESIS — BRL (JAN 2026)

1) The month’s true macro regime: “Disinflation trying to work, but BRL is constrained by fiscal + capital flows.”

Inflation prints (IPCA, IPCA-15, early pipeline) were cooperative.

The regime did not become dovish because the constraint migrated: fiscal credibility + capital-account quality.

2) Growth signal hierarchy (what investors actually believed):

Surveys (Dec PMIs) screamed slowdown; hard activity (industrial y/y) confirmed weakness early.

But retail resilience + later IBC-Br-style backdrop (from your earlier note set) prevented a clean “hard landing” narrative.
→ Net: growth was mixed / choppy, not collapsing — so policy cuts could not be justified purely on growth.

3) Reaction function (BCB): what moved it in January

Dovish inputs: soft PMIs, weak industrial y/y, benign inflation momentum.

Hawkish constraints: fiscal miss + FDI shock + any pipeline re-acceleration risks.
→ Net: BCB’s easing optionality did not expand; if anything, it became more conditional (“we can only ease if BRL/expectations stay anchored”).

4) BRL transmission (how the month would trade in a HF book):

BRL is a carry asset with a credibility premium.

When fiscal + FDI deteriorate, the market demands more carry for the same risk (or compresses positioning).

Cooperative inflation helps prevent panic, but it doesn’t compress the tail without better fiscal/flow follow-through.

Working BRL regime call (January end-state):
High carry remains the attraction, but tail risk premium should stay wide until fiscal optics and “quality inflows” stabilize.

BRL Macro Note — FOUNDATION (Brazil)
Date: 19 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Scope: Foundational regime anchor + reaction-function map
Primary window (last ~2 weeks of realised macro tape): 6 Jan 2026 – 19 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & structural constraints): past ~3–12 months

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

FOUNDATION REGIME (define the state of the world):
Brazil is in a “fiscal-dominance risk premium” regime where above-target inflation + unanchored expectations keep monetary policy restrictive, while fiscal slippage and election-binary politics create an episodic risk-premium channel. The external sector (trade surplus, reserves, domestic funding depth) reduces crisis probability, but does not remove the risk that fiscal shocks force tighter financial conditions and delay easing.

What is NEW in the last ~2 weeks (realised tape):

Inflation print confirms the constraint: year-end 2025 IPCA ended above target (4.26%), keeping the “restrictive stance is justified” anchor intact.

External cushion remains strong: December trade surplus printed exceptionally large and 2026 official trade-surplus guidance is high (wide band), reinforcing the “external buffers” pillar.

Political tail risk is not abstract: trade policy / tariff exposure narratives have become more salient; election framing remains “binary” for fiscal regime credibility.

What did NOT change:

The binding constraint remains services/wages + expectations, not imported goods inflation.

Fiscal credibility remains weak, so policy is anchored primarily by the central bank’s conservative posture.

The macro is stable day-to-day; the tails are what matter (risk premium, funding, political/fiscal credibility).

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: clear, sustained evidence that underlying inflation momentum and expectations are re-anchoring, alongside a fiscal stance that stops deteriorating.

Hawkish / defensive trigger: renewed BRL weakness + upside inflation surprises (especially services) or a fiscal shock that steepens the risk premium (rates/term premium, local funding costs).

“External shock” trigger: tariff/trade shock or global risk-off that hits Brazil through commodities terms-of-trade, capital flows, or USD funding conditions.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (last ~2 weeks, HF take)

9 Jan 2026 — IPCA (Dec / 2025 year-end)
Print: Dec m/m +0.33%; 2025 inflation ended at +4.26% y/y.
Dominant signal: inflation ended 2025 above target, consistent with expectations not fully anchored.
Secondary: composition matters (services momentum vs goods/food normalization), but the headline alone is enough to keep the “restrictive stance” narrative intact.
HF take: this does not force a hike; it raises the bar for early cuts unless the forward-looking inflation pulse (services/wages/expectations) improves.

6–7 Jan 2026 — Trade balance (Dec) + 2026 outlook guidance
Print: Dec trade surplus ~USD 9.6bn (record December); authorities guided to a 2026 trade surplus range ~USD 70–90bn.
Dominant signal: external accounts remain a stabilizer; trade cushion is still meaningful even if the current account is in deficit.
HF take: supports “no external crisis base case,” but does not solve the domestic fiscal/expectations problem. In stress, the external cushion buys time; it does not cap domestic risk premium.

13 Jan 2026 — Trade-policy / tariff exposure narrative (market-relevant tail)
Signal: Brazil’s trade relationships can create an exogenous tariff risk channel that markets may price as political risk premium / uncertainty.
HF take: second-order for growth near-term, but relevant for BRL risk premium and inflation tails if tariffs raise tradables prices or confidence.

(If no other major Brazil releases in this window, treat the rest as “no new realised prints”.)

Top-Down Macro — Framework

A) Growth / demand
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): growth moderating from ~2.3% (2025) toward ~1.8% (2026), constrained by tight monetary conditions and limited slack, partially supported by transfers/credit channels.
HF interpretation: the growth story is not the binding constraint; Brazil can grow modestly with high rates as long as fiscal impulse and credit channels remain supportive. The key is that policy must keep real rates high to prevent expectations from drifting further.

B) Inflation / “last mile”
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): headline ~4.3% in 2026, with services inflation elevated and expectations unmoored.
HF interpretation: the “last mile” is services/wages + expectations. Food normalization helps but does not deliver durable convergence if fiscal stance remains loose and capacity utilization is high.

C) Fiscal / credibility
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): overall deficit in the “8% handle” persists; debt near ~80% GDP end-2025 rising further in 2026; market skepticism vs official targets.
HF interpretation: Brazil’s macro is dominated by credibility math (debt dynamics + high real rates). Markets care less about the official target path than the probability the political system can deliver spending restraint. This is the central risk-premium engine.

D) External accounts / buffers
Realised tape: large trade surplus; official 2026 trade-surplus guidance high.
User-provided frame: current account deficit around 3% of GDP, financed by FDI / inflows.
HF interpretation: external resilience is a genuine stabilizer (low external debt, deep local markets, reserves), but capital account vulnerability rises sharply if fiscal credibility is questioned.

Binding constraint + next prints that matter
Binding constraint: inflation expectations + services/wage persistence under weak fiscal anchoring.
Next prints that matter most: services-inflation pulse, wage/negotiated wage dynamics, inflation expectations surveys (Focus) and any fiscal headlines that change perceived consolidation probability.

Central Bank — Last Meeting & Reaction Function

Last Central Bank Meeting — Copom (Brazil)
Meeting date: 10–11 December 2025
Decision: HOLD Selic at 15.00%
Vote: unanimous
Statement bias: restrictive, vigilance maintained

Official rationale (condensed):

Inflation remains above target and expectations are not fully anchored.

Services inflation and labour-intensive components show persistent momentum.

Fiscal stance and election-year uncertainty increase the need for policy caution.

External environment supportive, but not sufficient to offset domestic credibility risks.

Forward guidance (reaction-function language):

Policy will remain restrictive for a sufficiently long period.

Any easing is conditional, data-dependent, and explicitly linked to:

improvement in underlying inflation dynamics,

re-anchoring of expectations,

and orderly market reaction (BRL, inflation risk premium).

HF interpretation (foundation anchor):

Confirms the regime: not a mechanical easing cycle despite growth moderation.

The central bank acts as the primary macro anchor, compensating for weak fiscal credibility.

Election-year asymmetry: credibility preservation dominates; easier to delay/slow cuts than to accelerate them.

Political Outlook & Election Risk — FOUNDATION ANCHOR

Election calendar:

General elections: October 2026

Runoff (if needed): November 2026

Nature of the risk:
Brazil enters 2026 with a policy-binary electoral distribution. Markets price the election as a fork in the fiscal regime for 2027–2030.

Core market framing (non-partisan, structural):

The presidential race is expected to be close, with meaningful runoff probability.

The decisive variable is fiscal consolidation credibility, not short-term growth rhetoric.

Congressional composition matters: expectations of increased center-right/right representation reduce left-tail fiscal risk, but do not eliminate it.

Transmission channels (ordered by importance):

Fiscal credibility → risk premium: campaign signals on spending rules, primary balance targets, and debt stabilization dominate pricing.

Risk premium → BRL: FX is the first absorber; BRL weakness feeds into inflation expectations.

Inflation expectations → Copom reaction: drifting expectations delay/limit easing regardless of growth.

Rates / curve: election uncertainty steepens the curve and raises term premium without new data.

Interaction with monetary policy (reaction-function impact):

Election year raises the bar for dovishness.

Bias is credibility-protective: delaying cuts is easier than accelerating them if markets react poorly.

Monetary policy acts as a shock absorber for fiscal/political noise.

Tail-risk map:

Benign outcome: credible fiscal signals → risk premium compresses → BRL stabilizes → easing optionality improves in 2H 2026.

Adverse shock: fiscal slippage rhetoric / institutional stress → BRL sell-off → expectations unanchor → Copom stays restrictive longer.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution (foundation)

Rates:

Front-end anchored by “restrictive until expectations improve.”

Volatility driven more by fiscal/political headlines than growth data.

Tail: fiscal shock steepens curve, raises term premium, delays easing.

BRL:

Structural support: trade surplus, reserves, deep local markets.

Structural drag: fiscal credibility and election tails.

Trigger map:
• BRL-positive: credible fiscal signal + expectations re-anchor → faster easing optionality.
• BRL-negative: fiscal slippage / election uncertainty → risk premium spike; policy stays restrictive.

PM Self-Assessment (foundation quality): PASS as a regime anchor; live runs will require ongoing realised data tape updates.
