BRL Macro Note — FOUNDATION (Brazil)
Date: 19 Jan 2026 (Paris)
Scope: Foundational regime anchor + reaction-function map
Primary window (last ~2 weeks of realised macro tape): 6 Jan 2026 – 19 Jan 2026
Rolling perspective (anchors & structural constraints): past ~3–12 months

Executive Summary – Macro Regime & New Information

FOUNDATION REGIME (define the state of the world):
Brazil is in a “fiscal-dominance risk premium” regime where above-target inflation + unanchored expectations keep monetary policy restrictive, while fiscal slippage and election-binary politics create an episodic risk-premium channel. The external sector (trade surplus, reserves, domestic funding depth) reduces crisis probability, but does not remove the risk that fiscal shocks force tighter financial conditions and delay easing.

What is NEW in the last ~2 weeks (realised tape):

Inflation print confirms the constraint: year-end 2025 IPCA ended above target (4.26%), keeping the “restrictive stance is justified” anchor intact.

External cushion remains strong: December trade surplus printed exceptionally large and 2026 official trade-surplus guidance is high (wide band), reinforcing the “external buffers” pillar.

Political tail risk is not abstract: trade policy / tariff exposure narratives have become more salient; election framing remains “binary” for fiscal regime credibility.

What did NOT change:

The binding constraint remains services/wages + expectations, not imported goods inflation.

Fiscal credibility remains weak, so policy is anchored primarily by the central bank’s conservative posture.

The macro is stable day-to-day; the tails are what matter (risk premium, funding, political/fiscal credibility).

Regime-change triggers (what would force a pivot):

Dovish pivot trigger: clear, sustained evidence that underlying inflation momentum and expectations are re-anchoring, alongside a fiscal stance that stops deteriorating.

Hawkish / defensive trigger: renewed BRL weakness + upside inflation surprises (especially services) or a fiscal shock that steepens the risk premium (rates/term premium, local funding costs).

“External shock” trigger: tariff/trade shock or global risk-off that hits Brazil through commodities terms-of-trade, capital flows, or USD funding conditions.

Key Macro Releases – Primary Window (last ~2 weeks, HF take)

9 Jan 2026 — IPCA (Dec / 2025 year-end)
Print: Dec m/m +0.33%; 2025 inflation ended at +4.26% y/y.
Dominant signal: inflation ended 2025 above target, consistent with expectations not fully anchored.
Secondary: composition matters (services momentum vs goods/food normalization), but the headline alone is enough to keep the “restrictive stance” narrative intact.
HF take: this does not force a hike; it raises the bar for early cuts unless the forward-looking inflation pulse (services/wages/expectations) improves.

6–7 Jan 2026 — Trade balance (Dec) + 2026 outlook guidance
Print: Dec trade surplus ~USD 9.6bn (record December); authorities guided to a 2026 trade surplus range ~USD 70–90bn.
Dominant signal: external accounts remain a stabilizer; trade cushion is still meaningful even if the current account is in deficit.
HF take: supports “no external crisis base case,” but does not solve the domestic fiscal/expectations problem. In stress, the external cushion buys time; it does not cap domestic risk premium.

13 Jan 2026 — Trade-policy / tariff exposure narrative (market-relevant tail)
Signal: Brazil’s trade relationships can create an exogenous tariff risk channel that markets may price as political risk premium / uncertainty.
HF take: second-order for growth near-term, but relevant for BRL risk premium and inflation tails if tariffs raise tradables prices or confidence.

(If no other major Brazil releases in this window, treat the rest as “no new realised prints”.)

Top-Down Macro — Framework

A) Growth / demand
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): growth moderating from ~2.3% (2025) toward ~1.8% (2026), constrained by tight monetary conditions and limited slack, partially supported by transfers/credit channels.
HF interpretation: the growth story is not the binding constraint; Brazil can grow modestly with high rates as long as fiscal impulse and credit channels remain supportive. The key is that policy must keep real rates high to prevent expectations from drifting further.

B) Inflation / “last mile”
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): headline ~4.3% in 2026, with services inflation elevated and expectations unmoored.
HF interpretation: the “last mile” is services/wages + expectations. Food normalization helps but does not deliver durable convergence if fiscal stance remains loose and capacity utilization is high.

C) Fiscal / credibility
Baseline (user-provided macro frame): overall deficit in the “8% handle” persists; debt near ~80% GDP end-2025 rising further in 2026; market skepticism vs official targets.
HF interpretation: Brazil’s macro is dominated by credibility math (debt dynamics + high real rates). Markets care less about the official target path than the probability the political system can deliver spending restraint. This is the central risk-premium engine.

D) External accounts / buffers
Realised tape: large trade surplus; official 2026 trade-surplus guidance high.
User-provided frame: current account deficit around 3% of GDP, financed by FDI / inflows.
HF interpretation: external resilience is a genuine stabilizer (low external debt, deep local markets, reserves), but capital account vulnerability rises sharply if fiscal credibility is questioned.

Binding constraint + next prints that matter
Binding constraint: inflation expectations + services/wage persistence under weak fiscal anchoring.
Next prints that matter most: services-inflation pulse, wage/negotiated wage dynamics, inflation expectations surveys (Focus) and any fiscal headlines that change perceived consolidation probability.

Central Bank — Last Meeting & Reaction Function

Last Central Bank Meeting — Copom (Brazil)
Meeting date: 10–11 December 2025
Decision: HOLD Selic at 15.00%
Vote: unanimous
Statement bias: restrictive, vigilance maintained

Official rationale (condensed):

Inflation remains above target and expectations are not fully anchored.

Services inflation and labour-intensive components show persistent momentum.

Fiscal stance and election-year uncertainty increase the need for policy caution.

External environment supportive, but not sufficient to offset domestic credibility risks.

Forward guidance (reaction-function language):

Policy will remain restrictive for a sufficiently long period.

Any easing is conditional, data-dependent, and explicitly linked to:

improvement in underlying inflation dynamics,

re-anchoring of expectations,

and orderly market reaction (BRL, inflation risk premium).

HF interpretation (foundation anchor):

Confirms the regime: not a mechanical easing cycle despite growth moderation.

The central bank acts as the primary macro anchor, compensating for weak fiscal credibility.

Election-year asymmetry: credibility preservation dominates; easier to delay/slow cuts than to accelerate them.

Political Outlook & Election Risk — FOUNDATION ANCHOR

Election calendar:

General elections: October 2026

Runoff (if needed): November 2026

Nature of the risk:
Brazil enters 2026 with a policy-binary electoral distribution. Markets price the election as a fork in the fiscal regime for 2027–2030.

Core market framing (non-partisan, structural):

The presidential race is expected to be close, with meaningful runoff probability.

The decisive variable is fiscal consolidation credibility, not short-term growth rhetoric.

Congressional composition matters: expectations of increased center-right/right representation reduce left-tail fiscal risk, but do not eliminate it.

Transmission channels (ordered by importance):

Fiscal credibility → risk premium: campaign signals on spending rules, primary balance targets, and debt stabilization dominate pricing.

Risk premium → BRL: FX is the first absorber; BRL weakness feeds into inflation expectations.

Inflation expectations → Copom reaction: drifting expectations delay/limit easing regardless of growth.

Rates / curve: election uncertainty steepens the curve and raises term premium without new data.

Interaction with monetary policy (reaction-function impact):

Election year raises the bar for dovishness.

Bias is credibility-protective: delaying cuts is easier than accelerating them if markets react poorly.

Monetary policy acts as a shock absorber for fiscal/political noise.

Tail-risk map:

Benign outcome: credible fiscal signals → risk premium compresses → BRL stabilizes → easing optionality improves in 2H 2026.

Adverse shock: fiscal slippage rhetoric / institutional stress → BRL sell-off → expectations unanchor → Copom stays restrictive longer.

Cross-Market – Rates / FX / Risk Attribution (foundation)

Rates:

Front-end anchored by “restrictive until expectations improve.”

Volatility driven more by fiscal/political headlines than growth data.

Tail: fiscal shock steepens curve, raises term premium, delays easing.

BRL:

Structural support: trade surplus, reserves, deep local markets.

Structural drag: fiscal credibility and election tails.

Trigger map:
• BRL-positive: credible fiscal signal + expectations re-anchor → faster easing optionality.
• BRL-negative: fiscal slippage / election uncertainty → risk premium spike; policy stays restrictive.

PM Self-Assessment (foundation quality): PASS as a regime anchor; live runs will require ongoing realised data tape updates.
